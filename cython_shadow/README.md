Cython-Shadow
=============

The Cython-Shadow package contains the files necessary for `import cython` to work
but not the Cython compiler itself.  It is intended as a lightweight dependency
for projects that want to implement an optional Cython-compiled mode using the
"pure Python" syntax.  Cython-Shadow the non-compiled versions to use
Cython type annotations and decorators without needing Cython as a dependency.
