Cython - Installation Instructions
==================================

You have two installation options:

(1) Run the setup.py script in this directory
    as follows:

        python setup.py install

    This will install the Cython package
    into your Python system.

OR

(2) If you prefer not to modify your Python
    installation, arrange for the directory
    containing this file (INSTALL.txt) to be in
    your PYTHONPATH. On unix, also put the bin
    directory on your PATH.

See README.txt for pointers to other documentation.
