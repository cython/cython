This example demonstrates how you can wrap a C APIthat has a callback interface, so that you canpass Python functions to it as callbacks.The files cheesefinder.h and cheesefinder.crepresent the C library to be wrapped.The file cheese.pyx is the Pyrex modulewhich wraps it.The file run_cheese.py demonstrates how tocall the wrapper.
