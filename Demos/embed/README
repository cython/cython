This example demonstrates how Pyrex-generated codecan be called directly from a main program written in C.In this example, the module's initialisation function(called "initembedded", since the module is called"embedded") is called explicitly. This is necessarybecause the module is not being imported using thenormal Python import mechanism.The Windows makefiles were contributed byDuncan Booth <Duncan.Booth@SuttonCourtenay.org.uk>.
