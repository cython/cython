Cython Changelog
================

3.0.0 alpha 8 (2021-??-??)
==========================

Features added
--------------

* A ``@cython.total_ordering`` decorator has been added to automatically
  implement all comparison operators, similar to ``functools.total_ordering``.
  Patch by Spencer Brown.  (Github issue :issue:`2090`)

* C++17 execution policies are supported in ``libcpp.algorithm``.
  Patch by Ashwin Srinath.  (Github issue :issue:`3790`)

* New C feature flags: ``CYTHON_USE_MODULE_STATE``, ``CYTHON_USE_TYPE_SPECS``
  Both are currently considered experimental.
  (Github issue :issue:`3611`)

Bugs fixed
----------

* Code optimisations were not applied to methods of Cython implemented C++ classes.
  Patch by David Woods.  (Github issue #4212)

* An unnecessary slow-down at import time was removed from ``Cython.Distutils``.
  Original patch by Anthony Sottile.  (Github issue #4224)

* The signature of ``PyFloat_FromString()`` in ``cpython.float`` was changed
  to match the signature in Py3.  It still has an automatic fallback for Py2.
  (Github issue :issue:`3909`)

* A compile error on MSVC was resolved.
  Patch by David Woods.  (Github issue #4202)

* A C compiler warning in PyPy3 regarding ``PyEval_EvalCode()`` was resolved.

Other changes
-------------

* Support for the now unsupported Pyston V1 was removed in favour of Pyston V2.
  Patch by Marius Wachtler.  (Github issue #4211)

* The ``Cython.Build.BuildExecutable`` tool no longer executes the program automatically.
  Use ``cythonrun`` for that.


3.0.0 alpha 7 (2021-05-24)
==========================

Features added
--------------

* ``__class_getitem__`` (`PEP-560`_) is supported for cdef classes.
  Patch by Kmol Yuan.  (Github issue :issue:`3764`)

* ``__mro_entries__`` (`PEP-560`_) is supported for Python classes.
  Patch by David Woods.  (Github issue :issue:`3537`)

* ``cython.array`` supports simple, non-strided views.
  (Github issue :issue:`3775`)

* Self-documenting f-strings (``=``) were implemented.
  Patch by davfsa.  (Github issue :issue:`3796`)

* The destructor is now called for fields in C++ structs.
  Patch by David Woods.  (Github issue :issue:`3226`)

* ``std::move()`` is now also called for temps during ``yield``.
  Patch by Yu Feng.  (Github issue :issue:`4154`)

* ``asyncio.iscoroutinefunction()`` now recognises coroutine functions
  also when compiled by Cython.
  Patch by Pedro Marques da Luz.  (Github issue :issue:`2273`)

* C compiler warnings and errors are now shown in Jupyter notebooks.
  Patch by Egor Dranischnikow.  (Github issue :issue:`3751`)

* ``float(…)`` is optimised for string arguments (str/bytes/bytearray).

* Converting C++ containers to Python lists uses less memory allocations.
  Patch by Max Bachmann.  (Github issue :issue:`4081`)

* Docstrings of ``cpdef`` enums are now copied to the enum class.
  Patch by matham.  (Github issue :issue:`3805`)

* The type ``cython.Py_hash_t`` is available in Python mode.

* C-API declarations for ``cpython.fileobject`` were added.
  Patch by Zackery Spytz.  (Github issue :issue:`3906`)

* C-API declarations for context variables in Python 3.7 were added.
  Original patch by Zolisa Bleki.  (Github issue :issue:`2281`)

* More C-API declarations for ``cpython.datetime``  were added.
  Patch by Bluenix2.  (Github issue :issue:`4128`)

* A new module ``cpython.time`` was added with some low-level alternatives to
  Python's ``time`` module.
  Patch by Brock Mendel.  (Github issue :issue:`3767`)

* The value ``PyBUF_MAX_NDIM`` was added to the ``cpython.buffer`` module.
  Patch by John Kirkham.  (Github issue :issue:`3811`)

* "Declaration after use" is now an error for variables.
  Patch by David Woods.  (Github issue :issue:`3976`)

* More declarations for C++ string methods were added.

* Cython now detects when existing output files were not previously generated
  by itself and refuses to overwrite them.  It is a common mistake to name
  the module file of a wrapper after the library (source file) that it wraps,
  which can lead to surprising errors when the file gets overwritten.

Bugs fixed
----------

* Annotations were not exposed on annotated (data-)classes.
  Patch by matsjoyce.  (Github issue :issue:`4151`)

* Inline functions and other code in ``.pxd`` files could accidentally
  inherit the compiler directives of the ``.pyx`` file that imported them.
  Patch by David Woods.  (Github issue :issue:`1071`)

* Some issues were resolved that could lead to duplicated C names.
  Patch by David Woods.  (Github issue :issue:`3716`, :issue:`3741`, :issue:`3734`)

  Patch by Serge Guelton.  (Github issue :issue:`3762`)

* Casting to ctuples is now allowed.
  Patch by David Woods.  (Github issue :issue:`3808`)

* Structs could not be instantiated with positional arguments in
  pure Python mode.

* Literal list assignments to pointer variables declared in PEP-526
  notation failed to compile.

* Nested C++ types were not usable through ctypedefs.
  Patch by Vadim Pushtaev.  (Github issue :issue:`4039`)

* Overloaded C++ static methods were lost.
  Patch by Ashwin Srinath.  (Github :issue:`1851`)

* Cython compiled functions always provided a ``__self__`` attribute,
  regardless of being used as a method or not.
  Patch by David Woods.  (Github issue :issue:`4036`)

* Calls to ``.__class__()`` of a known extension type failed.
  Patch by David Woods.  (Github issue :issue:`3954`)

* Generator expressions in pxd-overridden ``cdef`` functions could
  fail to compile.
  Patch by Matus Valo.  (Github issue :issue:`3477`)

* A reference leak on import failures was resolved.
  Patch by Max Bachmann.  (Github issue :issue:`4056`)

* A C compiler warning about unused code was resolved.

* An unsupported C-API call in PyPy was fixed.
  Patch by Max Bachmann.  (Github issue :issue:`4055`)

* The Cython ``CodeWriter`` mishandled no-argument ``return`` statements.
  Patch by Tao He.  (Github issue :issue:`3795`)

* ``complex`` wasn't supported in PEP-484 type annotations.
  Patch by David Woods.  (Github issue :issue:`3949`)

* Default arguments of methods were not exposed for introspection.
  Patch by Vladimir Matveev.  (Github issue :issue:`4061`)

* Extension types inheriting from Python classes could not safely
  be exposed in ``.pxd``  files.
  (Github issue :issue:`4106`)

* The profiling/tracing code was adapted to work with Python 3.10b1.

* The internal CPython macro ``Py_ISSPACE()`` is no longer used.
  Original patch by Andrew Jones.  (Github issue :issue:`4111`)

* Includes all bug-fixes from the :ref:`0.29.23` release.


3.0.0 alpha 6 (2020-07-31)
==========================

Features added
--------------

* Special methods for binary operators now follow Python semantics.
  Rather than e.g. a single ``__add__`` method for cdef classes, where
  "self" can be either the first or second argument, one can now define
  both ``__add__`` and ``__radd__`` as for standard Python classes.
  This behavior can be disabled with the ``c_api_binop_methods`` directive
  to return to the previous semantics in Cython code (available from Cython
  0.29.20), or the reversed method (``__radd__``) can be implemented in
  addition to an existing two-sided operator method (``__add__``) to get a
  backwards compatible implementation.
  (Github issue :issue:`2056`)

* No/single argument functions now accept keyword arguments by default in order
  to comply with Python semantics.  The marginally faster calling conventions
  ``METH_NOARGS`` and ``METH_O`` that reject keyword arguments are still available
  with the directive ``@cython.always_allow_keywords(False)``.
  (Github issue :issue:`3090`)

* For-in-loop iteration over ``bytearray`` and memory views is optimised.
  Patch by David Woods.  (Github issue :issue:`2227`)

* Type inference now works for memory views and slices.
  Patch by David Woods.  (Github issue :issue:`2227`)

* The ``@returns()`` decorator propagates exceptions by default for suitable C
  return types when no ``@exceptval()`` is defined.
  (Github issues :issue:`3625`, :issue:`3664`)

* A low-level inline function ``total_seconds(timedelta)`` was added to
  ``cpython.datetime`` to bypass the Python method call.  Note that this function
  is not guaranteed to give exactly the same results for very large time intervals.
  Patch by Brock Mendel.  (Github issue :issue:`3616`)

* Type inference now understands that ``a, *b = x`` assigns a list to ``b``.

* Limited API support was improved.
  Patches by Matthias Braun.  (Github issues :issue:`3693`, :issue:`3707`)

* The Cython ``CodeWriter`` can now handle more syntax constructs.
  Patch by Tao He.  (Github issue :issue:`3514`)

Bugs fixed
----------

* The construct ``for x in cpp_function_call()`` failed to compile.
  Patch by David Woods.  (Github issue :issue:`3663`)

* C++ references failed to compile when used as Python object indexes.
  Patch by David Woods.  (Github issue :issue:`3754`)

* The C++ ``typeid()`` function was allowed in C mode.
  Patch by Celelibi.  (Github issue :issue:`3637`)

* ``repr()`` was assumed to return ``str`` instead of ``unicode`` with ``language_level=3``.
  (Github issue :issue:`3736`)

* Includes all bug-fixes from the :ref:`0.29.21` release.

Other changes
-------------

* The ``numpy`` declarations were updated.
  Patch by Brock Mendel.  (Github issue #3630)

* The names of Cython's internal types (functions, generator, coroutine, etc.)
  are now qualified with the module name of the internal Cython module that is
  used for sharing them across Cython implemented modules, for example
  ``_cython_3_0a5.coroutine``.  This was done to avoid making them look like
  homeless builtins, to help with debugging, and in order to avoid a CPython
  warning according to https://bugs.python.org/issue20204

3.0.0 alpha 5 (2020-05-19)
==========================

Features added
--------------

* ``.pxd`` files can now be :ref:`versioned <versioning>` by adding an
  extension like "``.cython-30.pxd``" to prevent older Cython versions (than
  3.0 in this case) from picking them up.  (Github issue :issue:`3577`)

* Several macros/functions declared in the NumPy API are now usable without
  holding the GIL.

* `libc.math` was extended to include all C99 function declarations.
  Patch by Dean Scarff.  (Github issue :issue:`3570`)

Bugs fixed
----------

* Several issues with arithmetic overflow handling were resolved, including
  undefined behaviour in C.
  Patch by Sam Sneddon.  (Github issue :issue:`3588`)

* The improved GIL handling in ``nogil`` functions introduced in 3.0a3
  could fail to acquire the GIL in some cases on function exit.
  (Github issue :issue:`3590` etc.)

* A reference leak when processing keyword arguments in Py2 was resolved,
  that appeared in 3.0a1.
  (Github issue :issue:`3578`)

* The outdated getbuffer/releasebuffer implementations in the NumPy
  declarations were removed so that buffers declared as ``ndarray``
  now use the normal implementation in NumPy.

* Includes all bug-fixes from the :ref:`0.29.18` release.


3.0.0 alpha 4 (2020-05-05)
==========================

Features added
--------------

* The ``print`` statement (not the ``print()`` function) is allowed in
  ``nogil`` code without an explicit ``with gil`` section.

* The ``assert`` statement is allowed in ``nogil`` sections.  Here, the GIL is
  only acquired if the ``AssertionError`` is really raised, which means that the
  evaluation of the asserted condition only allows C expressions.

* Cython generates C compiler branch hints for unlikely user defined if-clauses
  in more cases, when they end up raising exceptions unconditionally. This now
  includes exceptions being raised in ``nogil``/``with gil`` sections.

* Some internal memoryview functions were tuned to reduce object overhead.

Bugs fixed
----------

* Exception position reporting could run into race conditions on threaded code.
  It now uses function-local variables again.

* Error handling early in the module init code could lead to a crash.

* Error handling in ``cython.array`` creation was improved to avoid calling
  C-API functions with an error held.

* Complex buffer item types of structs of arrays could fail to validate.
  Patch by Leo and smutch.  (Github issue :issue:`1407`)

* When importing the old Cython ``build_ext`` integration with distutils, the
  additional command line arguments leaked into the regular command.
  Patch by Kamekameha.  (Github issue :issue:`2209`)

* The improved GIL handling in ``nogil`` functions introduced in 3.0a3
  could generate invalid C code.
  (Github issue :issue:`3558`)

* ``PyEval_InitThreads()`` is no longer used in Py3.7+ where it is a no-op.

* Parallel builds of Cython itself (``setup.py build_ext -j N``) failed on Windows.

Other changes
-------------

* The C property feature has been rewritten and now requires C property methods
  to be declared ``inline`` (:issue:`3571`).


3.0.0 alpha 3 (2020-04-27)
==========================

Features added
--------------

* ``nogil`` functions now avoid acquiring the GIL on function exit if possible
  even if they contain ``with gil`` blocks.
  (Github issue :issue:`3554`)

* Python private name mangling now falls back to unmangled names for non-Python
  globals, since double-underscore names are not uncommon in C.  Unmangled Python
  names are also still found as a legacy fallback but produce a warning.
  Patch by David Woods.  (Github issue :issue:`3548`)

Bugs fixed
----------

* Includes all bug-fixes from the :ref:`0.29.17` release.


3.0.0 alpha 2 (2020-04-23)
==========================

Features added
--------------

* ``std::move()`` is now used in C++ mode for internal temp variables to
  make them work without copying values.
  Patch by David Woods.  (Github issues :issue:`3253`, :issue:`1612`)

* ``__class_getitem__`` is supported for types on item access (`PEP-560`_).
  Patch by msg555.  (Github issue :issue:`2753`)

* The simplified Py3.6 customisation of class creation is implemented (`PEP-487`_).
  (Github issue #2781)

* Conditional blocks in Python code that depend on ``cython.compiled`` are
  eliminated at an earlier stage, which gives more freedom in writing
  replacement Python code.
  Patch by David Woods.  (Github issue :issue:`3507`)

* ``numpy.import_array()`` is automatically called if ``numpy`` has been cimported
  and it has not been called in the module code.  This is intended as a hidden
  fail-safe so user code should continue to call ``numpy.import_array``.
  Patch by David Woods.  (Github issue :issue:`3524`)

* The Cython AST code serialiser class ``CodeWriter`` in ``Cython.CodeWriter``
  supports more syntax nodes.

* The fastcall/vectorcall protocols are used for several internal Python calls.
  (Github issue :issue:`3540`)

Bugs fixed
----------

* With ``language_level=3/3str``, Python classes without explicit base class
  are now new-style (type) classes also in Py2.  Previously, they were created
  as old-style (non-type) classes.
  (Github issue :issue:`3530`)

* C++ ``typeid()`` failed for fused types.
  Patch by David Woods.  (Github issue :issue:`3203`)

* ``__arg`` argument names in methods were not mangled with the class name.
  Patch by David Woods.  (Github issue :issue:`1382`)

* Creating an empty unicode slice with large bounds could crash.
  Patch by Sam Sneddon.  (Github issue :issue:`3531`)

* Decoding an empty bytes/char* slice with large bounds could crash.
  Patch by Sam Sneddon.  (Github issue :issue:`3534`)

* Temporary buffer indexing variables were not released and could show up in
  C compiler warnings, e.g. in generators.
  Patch by David Woods.  (Github issues :issue:`3430`, :issue:`3522`)

* Several C compiler warnings were fixed.


3.0.0 alpha 1 (2020-04-12)
==========================

Features added
--------------

* Cython functions now use the `PEP-590`_ vectorcall protocol in Py3.7+.
  Patch by Jeroen Demeyer.  (Github issue :issue:`2263`)

* Unicode identifiers are supported in Cython code (`PEP-3131`_).
  Patch by David Woods.  (Github issue :issue:`2601`)

* Unicode module names and imports are supported.
  Patch by David Woods.  (Github issue :issue:`3119`)

* Annotations are no longer parsed, keeping them as strings following `PEP-563`_.
  Patch by David Woods.  (Github issue :issue:`3285`)

* Preliminary support for the CPython's ``Py_LIMITED_API`` (stable ABI) is
  available by setting the  ``CYTHON_LIMITED_API`` C macro.  Note that the
  support is currently in an early stage and many features do not yet work.
  You currently still have to define ``Py_LIMITED_API`` externally in order
  to restrict the API usage.  This will change when the feature stabilises.
  Patches by Eddie Elizondo and David Woods.  (Github issues :issue:`3223`,
  :issue:`3311`, :issue:`3501`)

* The dispatch to fused functions is now linear in the number of arguments,
  which makes it much faster, often 2x or more, and several times faster for
  larger fused types with many specialisations.
  Patch by will-ca.  (Github issue :issue:`1385`)

* ``with gil/nogil`` statements can be conditional based on compile-time
  constants, e.g. fused type checks.
  Patch by Noam Hershtig.  (Github issue :issue:`2579`)

* ``const`` can be used together with fused types.
  Patch by Thomas Vincent.  (Github issue :issue:`1772`)

* Reimports of already imported modules are substantially faster.
  (Github issue :issue:`2854`)

* Positional-only arguments are supported in Python functions (`PEP-570`_).
  Patch by Josh Tobin.  (Github issue :issue:`2915`)

* The ``volatile`` C modifier is supported in Cython code.
  Patch by Jeroen Demeyer.  (Github issue #1667)

* ``@cython.trashcan(True)`` can be used on an extension type to enable the
  CPython :ref:`trashcan`. This allows deallocating deeply recursive objects
  without overflowing the stack. Patch by Jeroen Demeyer.  (Github issue :issue:`2842`)

* Inlined properties can be defined for external extension types.
  Patch by Matti Picus. (Github issue :issue:`2640`, redone later in :issue:`3571`)

* The ``str()`` builtin now calls ``PyObject_Str()`` instead of going
  through a Python call.
  Patch by William Ayd.  (Github issue :issue:`3279`)

* String concatenation can now happen in place if possible, by extending the
  existing string rather than always creating a new one.
  Patch by David Woods.  (Github issue :issue:`3453`)

* Multiplication of Python numbers with small constant integers is faster.
  (Github issue :issue:`2808`)

* Some list copying is avoided internally when a new list needs to be created
  but we already have a fresh one.
  (Github issue :issue:`3494`)

* Extension types that do not need their own ``tp_new`` implementation (because
  they have no object attributes etc.) directly inherit the implementation of
  their parent type if possible.
  (Github issue :issue:`1555`)

* The attributes ``gen.gi_frame`` and ``coro.cr_frame`` of Cython compiled
  generators and coroutines now return an actual frame object for introspection.
  (Github issue :issue:`2306`)

* Several declarations in ``cpython.*``, ``libc.*`` and ``libcpp.*`` were added.
  Patches by Jeroen Demeyer, Matthew Edwards, Chris Gyurgyik, Jerome Kieffer
  and Zackery Spytz.
  (Github issues :issue:`3468`, :issue:`3332`, :issue:`3202`, :issue:`3188`,
  :issue:`3179`, :issue:`2891`, :issue:`2826`, :issue:`2713`)

* Deprecated NumPy API usages were removed from ``numpy.pxd``.
  Patch by Matti Picus.  (Github issue :issue:`3365`)

* ``cython.inline()`` now sets the ``NPY_NO_DEPRECATED_API=NPY_1_7_API_VERSION``
  C macro automatically when ``numpy`` is imported in the code, to avoid C compiler
  warnings about deprecated NumPy C-API usage.

* The builtin ``abs()`` function can now be used on C numbers in nogil code.
  Patch by Elliott Sales de Andrade.  (Github issue :issue:`2748`)

* `PEP-479`_ (``generator_stop``) is now enabled by default with language level 3.
  (Github issue :issue:`2580`)

* The ``cython.view.array`` type supports inheritance.
  Patch by David Woods.  (Github issue :issue:`3413`)

* Code annotation accepts a new debugging argument ``--annotate-fullc`` that
  will include the complete syntax highlighted C file in the HTML output.
  (Github issue :issue:`2855`)

* ``--no-capture`` added to ``runtests.py`` to prevent stdout/stderr capturing
  during srctree tests.
  Patch by Matti Picus.  (Github issue :issue:`2701`)

* ``--no-docstrings`` option added to ``cythonize`` script.
  Original patch by mo-han.  (Github issue :issue:`2889`)

* ``cygdb`` gives better error messages when it fails to initialise the
  Python runtime support in gdb.
  Patch by Volker Weissmann.  (Github issue :issue:`3489`)

* The Pythran ``shape`` attribute is supported.
  Patch by Serge Guelton.  (Github issue :issue:`3307`)

Bugs fixed
----------

* The unicode methods ``.upper()``, ``.lower()`` and ``.title()`` were
  incorrectly optimised for single character input values and only returned
  the first character if multiple characters should have been returned.
  They now use the original Python methods again.

* Fused argument types were not correctly handled in type annotations and
  ``cython.locals()``.
  Patch by David Woods.  (Github issues :issue:`3391`, :issue:`3142`)

* Diverging from the usual behaviour, ``len(memoryview)``, ``len(char*)``
  and ``len(Py_UNICODE*)`` returned an unsigned ``size_t`` value.  They now
  return a signed ``Py_ssize_t``, like other usages of ``len()``.

* Nested dict literals in function call kwargs could incorrectly raise an
  error about duplicate keyword arguments, which are allowed when passing
  them from dict literals.
  (Github issue :issue:`2963`)

* Item access (subscripting) with integer indices/keys always tried the
  Sequence protocol before the Mapping protocol, which diverged from Python
  semantics.  It now passes through the Mapping protocol first when supported.
  (Github issue :issue:`1807`)

* Name lookups in class bodies no longer go through an attribute lookup.
  Patch by Jeroen Demeyer.  (Github issue :issue:`3100`)

* Broadcast assignments to a multi-dimensional memory view slice could end
  up in the wrong places when the underlying memory view is known to be
  contiguous but the slice is not.
  (Github issue :issue:`2941`)

* Pickling unbound methods of Python classes failed.
  Patch by Pierre Glaser.  (Github issue :issue:`2972`)

* The ``Py_hash_t`` type failed to accept arbitrary "index" values.
  (Github issue :issue:`2752`)

* The first function line number of functions with decorators pointed to the
  signature line and not the first decorator line, as in Python.
  Patch by Felix Kohlgrüber.  (Github issue :issue:`2536`)

* Constant integer expressions that used a negative exponent were evaluated
  as integer 0 instead of the expected float value.
  Patch by Kryštof Pilnáček.  (Github issue :issue:`2133`)

* The ``cython.declare()`` and ``cython.cast()`` functions could fail in pure mode.
  Patch by Dmitry Shesterkin.  (Github issue :issue:`3244`)

* ``__doc__`` was not available inside of the class body during class creation.
  (Github issue :issue:`1635`)

* Setting ``language_level=2`` in a file did not work if ``language_level=3``
  was enabled globally before.
  Patch by Jeroen Demeyer.  (Github issue :issue:`2791`)

* ``__init__.pyx`` files were not always considered as package indicators.
  (Github issue :issue:`2665`)

* Compiling package ``__init__`` files could fail under Windows due to an
  undefined export symbol.  (Github issue :issue:`2968`)

* A C compiler cast warning was resolved.
  Patch by Michael Buesch.  (Github issue :issue:`2775`)

* Binding staticmethods of Cython functions were not behaving like Python methods.
  Patch by Jeroen Demeyer.  (Github issue :issue:`3106`, :issue:`3102`)

* Memoryviews failed to compile when the ``cache_builtins`` feature was disabled.
  Patch by David Woods.  (Github issue :issue:`3406`)

Other changes
-------------

* The default language level was changed to ``3str``, i.e. Python 3 semantics,
  but with ``str`` literals (also in Python 2.7).  This is a backwards incompatible
  change from the previous default of Python 2 semantics.  The previous behaviour
  is available through the directive ``language_level=2``.
  (Github issue :issue:`2565`)

* Cython no longer generates ``__qualname__`` attributes for classes in Python
  2.x since they are problematic there and not correctly maintained for subclasses.
  Patch by Jeroen Demeyer.  (Github issue :issue:`2772`)

* Source file fingerprinting now uses SHA-1 instead of MD5 since the latter
  tends to be slower and less widely supported these days.
  (Github issue :issue:`2790`)

* The long deprecated include files ``python_*``, ``stdio``, ``stdlib`` and
  ``stl`` in ``Cython/Includes/Deprecated/`` were removed.  Use the ``libc.*``
  and ``cpython.*`` pxd modules instead.
  Patch by Jeroen Demeyer.  (Github issue :issue:`2904`)

* The search order for include files was changed. Previously it was
  ``include_directories``, ``Cython/Includes``, ``sys.path``. Now it is
  ``include_directories``, ``sys.path``, ``Cython/Includes``. This was done to
  allow third-party ``*.pxd`` files to override the ones in Cython.
  Patch by Matti Picus.  (Github issue :issue:`2905`)

* The command line parser was rewritten and modernised using ``argparse``.
  Patch by Egor Dranischnikow.  (Github issue :issue:`2952`, :issue:`3001`)

* Dotted filenames for qualified module names (``pkg.mod.pyx``) are deprecated.
  Use the normal Python package directory layout instead.
  (Github issue :issue:`2686`)

* Binary Linux wheels now follow the manylinux2010 standard.
  Patch by Alexey Stepanov.  (Github issue :issue:`3355`)

* Support for Python 2.6 was removed.

.. _0.29.24:

0.29.24 (2021-??-??)
====================

Bugs fixed
----------

* Inline functions in pxd files that used memory views could lead to invalid
  C code if the module that imported from them does not use memory views.
  Patch by David Woods.  (Github issue #1415)

* The optimised ``in`` operator failed on unicode strings in Py3.9 and later
  that were constructed from an external ``wchar_t`` source.
  Also, related C compiler warnings about deprecated C-API usage were resolved.
  (Github issue #3925)

* The attributes ``gen.gi_frame`` and ``coro.cr_frame`` of Cython compiled
  generators and coroutines now return an actual frame object for introspection,
  instead of ``None``.
  (Github issue #2306)


.. _0.29.23:

  dict to leak into keyword arguments passed into a function.
  Patch by Peng Weikang.  (Github issue #3227)

* Multiplied str constants could end up as bytes constants with language_level=2.
  Patch by Alphadelta14 and David Woods.  (Github issue #3951)

* ``PY_SSIZE_T_CLEAN`` does not get defined any more if it is already defined.
  Patch by Andrew Jones.  (Github issue #4104)


.. _0.29.22:

0.29.22 (2021-02-20)
====================

Features added
--------------

  (Github issue #2251)

* ``const`` template declarations could not be nested.
  Patch by Ashwin Srinath.  (Github issue #1355)

* The declarations in the ``cpython.pycapsule`` module were missing their
  ``const`` modifiers and generated incorrect C code.
  Patch by Warren Weckesser.  (Github issue #3964)

* Casts to memory views failed for fused dtypes.
  Patch by David Woods.  (Github issue #3881)

* ``repr()`` was assumed to return ``str`` instead of ``unicode`` with ``language_level=3``.
  (Github issue #3736)

* Calling ``cpdef`` functions from cimported modules crashed the compiler.
  Patch by David Woods.  (Github issue #4000)

* Cython no longer validates the ABI size of the NumPy classes it compiled against.
  See the discussion in https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/432

  (Github issue #2749)

* Coverage reporting in the annotated HTML file failed in Py3.9.
  Patch by Nick Pope.  (Github issue #3865)

* The embedding code now reports Python errors as exit status.

* Long type declarations could lead to (harmless) random changes in the
  C file when used in auto-generated Python wrappers or pickled classes.

Other changes
-------------

* Variables defined as ``cpdef`` now generate a warning since this
  is currently useless and thus does not do what users would expect.
  Patch by David Woods.  (Github issue #3959)


.. _0.29.21:

0.29.21 (2020-07-09)
====================

  Patch by Clemens Hofreither.  (Github issue #2093)

* ``exec()`` did not allow recent Python syntax features in Py3.8+ due to
  https://bugs.python.org/issue35975.
  (Github issue #3695)

* Binding staticmethods of Cython functions were not behaving like Python methods in Py3.
  Patch by Jeroen Demeyer and Michał Górny.  (Github issue #3106)

* Pythran calls to NumPy methods no longer generate useless method lookup code.

* The ``PyUnicode_GET_LENGTH()`` macro was missing from the ``cpython.*`` declarations.
  Patch by Thomas Caswell.  (Github issue #3692)

* The deprecated ``PyUnicode_*()`` C-API functions are no longer used, except for Unicode
  strings that contain lone surrogates.  Unicode strings that contain non-BMP characters
  or surrogate pairs now generate different C code on 16-bit Python 2.x Unicode deployments
  (such as MS-Windows).  Generating the C code on Python 3.x is recommended in this case.
  Original patches by Inada Naoki and Victor Stinner.  (Github issues #3677, #3721, #3697)

* Some template parameters were missing from the C++ ``std::unordered_map`` declaration.

  write access to these object fields.
  Patch by Victor Stinner.  (Github issue #3639)

* The built-in ``abs()`` function could lead to undefined behaviour when used on
  the negative-most value of a signed C integer type.
  Patch by Serge Guelton.  (Github issue #1911)

* Usages of ``sizeof()`` and ``typeid()`` on uninitialised variables no longer
  produce a warning.
  Patch by Celelibi.  (Github issue #3575)

* The C++ ``typeid()`` function was allowed in C mode.
  Patch by Celelibi.  (Github issue #3637)

* The error position reported for errors found in f-strings was misleading.
  (Github issue #3674)

* The new ``c_api_binop_methods`` directive was added for forward compatibility, but can
  only be set to True (the current default value).  It can be disabled in Cython 3.0.


.. _0.29.19:

* Error handling in ``cython.array`` creation was improved to avoid calling
  C-API functions with an error held.

* A memory corruption was fixed when garbage collection was triggered during calls
  to ``PyType_Ready()`` of extension type subclasses.
  (Github issue #3603)

* Memory view slicing generated unused error handling code which could negatively
  impact the C compiler optimisations for parallel OpenMP code etc.  Also, it is
  now helped by static branch hints.
  (Github issue #2987)

* Cython's built-in OpenMP functions were not translated inside of call arguments.
  Original patch by Celelibi and David Woods.  (Github issue #3594)

* Complex buffer item types of structs of arrays could fail to validate.
  Patch by Leo and smutch.  (Github issue #1407)

* When importing the old Cython ``build_ext`` integration with distutils, the
  additional command line arguments leaked into the regular command.
  Patch by Kamekameha.  (Github issue #2209)

* When using the ``CYTHON_NO_PYINIT_EXPORT`` option in C++, the module init function
  was not declared as ``extern "C"``.
  (Github issue #3414)

  Patch by Sam Sneddon.  (Github issue #3534)

* Re-importing a Cython extension no longer raises the error
  "``__reduce_cython__ not found``".
  (Github issue #3545)

* Unused C-tuples could generate incorrect code in 0.29.16.
  Patch by Kirk Meyer.  (Github issue #3543)

* Creating a fused function attached it to the garbage collector before it
  was fully initialised, thus risking crashes in rare failure cases.
  Original patch by achernomorov.  (Github issue #3215)

* Temporary buffer indexing variables were not released and could show up in
  C compiler warnings, e.g. in generators.
  Patch by David Woods.  (Github issues #3430, #3522)

* The compilation cache in ``cython.inline("…")`` failed to take the language
  level into account.

  (Github issue #3133).

* Distutils builds with ``--parallel`` did not work when using Cython's
  deprecated ``build_ext`` command.
  Patch by Alphadelta14 (Github issue #3187).

  Patch by Andrey Paramonov.  (Github issue #2644)

* Line tracing of ``try``-statements generated invalid C code.
  (Github issue #2274)

* When using the ``warn.undeclared`` directive, Cython's own code generated
  warnings that are now fixed.
  Patch by Nicolas Pauss.  (Github issue #2685)

* A struct field type in the ``cpython.array`` declarations was corrected.
  Patch by John Kirkham.  (Github issue #2712)


0.29 (2018-10-14)
=================

Features added
--------------

* PEP-489 multi-phase module initialisation has been enabled again.  Module
  reloads in other subinterpreters raise an exception to prevent corruption
  of the static module state.

* A set of ``mypy`` compatible PEP-484 declarations were added for Cython's C data
  types to integrate with static analysers in typed Python code.  They are available
  in the ``Cython/Shadow.pyi`` module and describe the types in the special ``cython``
  module that can be used for typing in Python code.
  Original patch by Julian Gethmann. (Github issue #1965)

* Memoryviews are supported in PEP-484/526 style type declarations.
  (Github issue #2529)

* ``@cython.nogil`` is supported as a C-function decorator in Python code.
  (Github issue #2557)

* Raising exceptions from nogil code will automatically acquire the GIL, instead
  of requiring an explicit ``with gil`` block.

* C++ functions can now be declared as potentially raising both C++ and Python
  exceptions, so that Cython can handle both correctly.
  (Github issue #2615)

* ``cython.inline()`` supports a direct ``language_level`` keyword argument that
  was previously only available via a directive.

* A new language level name ``3str`` was added that mostly corresponds to language
  level 3, but keeps unprefixed string literals as type 'str' in both Py2 and Py3,
  and the builtin 'str' type unchanged.  This will become the default in the next
  Cython release and is meant to help user code a) transition more easily to this
  new default and b) migrate to Python 3 source code semantics without making support
  for Python 2.x difficult.

* In CPython 3.6 and later, looking up globals in the module dict is almost
  as fast as looking up C globals.
  (Github issue #2313)

* For a Python subclass of an extension type, repeated method calls to non-overridden
  cpdef methods can avoid the attribute lookup in Py3.6+, which makes them 4x faster.
  (Github issue #2313)

* (In-)equality comparisons of objects to integer literals are faster.
  (Github issue #2188)

* Some internal and 1-argument method calls are faster.

* Modules that cimport many external extension types from other Cython modules
  execute less import requests during module initialisation.

* Constant tuples and slices are deduplicated and only created once per module.
  (Github issue #2292)

* The coverage plugin considers more C file extensions such as ``.cc`` and ``.cxx``.
  (Github issue #2266)

* The ``cythonize`` command accepts compile time variable values (as set by ``DEF``)
  through the new ``-E`` option.
  Patch by Jerome Kieffer.  (Github issue #2315)

* ``pyximport`` can import from namespace packages.
  Patch by Prakhar Goel.  (Github issue #2294)

* Some missing numpy and CPython C-API declarations were added.
  Patch by John Kirkham. (Github issues #2523, #2520, #2537)

* Declarations for the ``pylifecycle`` C-API functions were added in a new .pxd file
  ``cpython.pylifecycle``.

* The Pythran support was updated to work with the latest Pythran 0.8.7.
  Original patch by Adrien Guinet.  (Github issue #2600)

* ``%a`` is included in the string formatting types that are optimised into f-strings.
  In this case, it is also automatically mapped to ``%r`` in Python 2.x.

* New C macro ``CYTHON_HEX_VERSION`` to access Cython's version in the same style as
  ``PY_VERSION_HEX``.

* Constants in ``libc.math`` are now declared as ``const`` to simplify their handling.

* An additional ``check_size`` clause was added to the ``ctypedef class`` name
  specification to allow suppressing warnings when importing modules with
  backwards-compatible ``PyTypeObject`` size changes.
  Patch by Matti Picus.  (Github issue #2627)

* The exception handling in generators and coroutines under CPython 3.7 was adapted
  to the newly introduced exception stack.  Users of Cython 0.28 who want to support
  Python 3.7 are encouraged to upgrade to 0.29 to avoid potentially incorrect error
  reporting and tracebacks.  (Github issue #1958)

* Crash when importing a module under Stackless Python that was built for CPython.
  Patch by Anselm Kruis.  (Github issue #2534)

* 2-value slicing of typed sequences failed if the start or stop index was None.
  Patch by Christian Gibson.  (Github issue #2508)

* Multiplied string literals lost their factor when they are part of another
  constant expression (e.g. 'x' * 10 + 'y' => 'xy').

* String formatting with the '%' operator didn't call the special ``__rmod__()``
  method if the right side is a string subclass that implements it.
  (Python issue 28598)

* The directive ``language_level=3`` did not apply to the first token in the
  source file.  (Github issue #2230)

* Overriding cpdef methods did not work in Python subclasses with slots.
  Note that this can have a performance impact on calls from Cython code.
  (Github issue #1771)

* Fix declarations of builtin or C types using strings in pure python mode.
  (Github issue #2046)

* Generator expressions and lambdas failed to compile in ``@cfunc`` functions.
  (Github issue #459)

* Global names with ``const`` types were not excluded from star-import assignments
  which could lead to invalid C code.
  (Github issue #2621)

* Several internal function signatures were fixed that lead to warnings in gcc-8.
  (Github issue #2363)

* The numpy helper functions ``set_array_base()`` and ``get_array_base()``
  were adapted to the current numpy C-API recommendations.
  Patch by Matti Picus. (Github issue #2528)

* Some NumPy related code was updated to avoid deprecated API usage.
  Original patch by jbrockmendel.  (Github issue #2559)

* Several C++ STL declarations were extended and corrected.
  Patch by Valentin Valls. (Github issue #2207)

* C lines of the module init function were unconditionally not reported in
  exception stack traces.
  Patch by Jeroen Demeyer.  (Github issue #2492)

* When PEP-489 support is enabled, reloading the module overwrote any static
  module state. It now raises an exception instead, given that reloading is
  not actually supported.

* Object-returning, C++ exception throwing functions were not checking that
  the return value was non-null.
  Original patch by Matt Wozniski (Github Issue #2603)

* The source file encoding detection could get confused if the
  ``c_string_encoding`` directive appeared within the first two lines.
  (Github issue #2632)

* Cython generated modules no longer emit a warning during import when the
  size of the NumPy array type is larger than what was found at compile time.
  Instead, this is assumed to be a backwards compatible change on NumPy side.

Other changes
-------------

* Cython now emits a warning when no ``language_level`` (2, 3 or '3str') is set
  explicitly, neither as a ``cythonize()`` option nor as a compiler directive.
  This is meant to prepare the transition of the default language level from
  currently Py2 to Py3, since that is what most new users will expect these days.
  The future default will, however, not enforce unicode literals, because this
  has proven a major obstacle in the support for both Python 2.x and 3.x.  The
  next major release is intended to make this change, so that it will parse all
  code that does not request a specific language level as Python 3 code, but with
  ``str`` literals.  The language level 2 will continue to be supported for an
  indefinite time.

* The documentation was restructured, cleaned up and examples are now tested.
  The NumPy tutorial was also rewritten to simplify the running example.
  Contributed by Gabriel de Marmiesse.  (Github issue #2245)

* Cython compiles less of its own modules at build time to reduce the installed
  package size to about half of its previous size.  This makes the compiler
  slightly slower, by about 5-7%.


0.28.6 (2018-11-01)
===================

Bugs fixed
----------

* Extensions compiled with MinGW-64 under Windows could misinterpret integer
  objects larger than 15 bit and return incorrect results.
  (Github issue #2670)

* Multiplied string literals lost their factor when they are part of another
  constant expression (e.g. 'x' * 10 + 'y' => 'xy').


0.28.5 (2018-08-03)
===================

Bugs fixed
----------

* The discouraged usage of GCC's attribute ``optimize("Os")`` was replaced by the
  similar attribute ``cold`` to reduce the code impact of the module init functions.
  (Github issue #2494)

* A reference leak in Py2.x was fixed when comparing str to unicode for equality.


0.28.4 (2018-07-08)
===================

Bugs fixed
----------

* Reallowing ``tp_clear()`` in a subtype of an ``@no_gc_clear`` extension type
  generated an invalid C function call to the (non-existent) base type implementation.
  (Github issue #2309)

* Exception catching based on a non-literal (runtime) tuple could fail to match the
  exception.  (Github issue #2425)

* Compile fix for CPython 3.7.0a2.  (Github issue #2477)


0.28.3 (2018-05-27)
===================

Bugs fixed
----------

* Set iteration was broken in non-CPython since 0.28.

* ``UnicodeEncodeError`` in Py2 when ``%s`` formatting is optimised for
  unicode strings.  (Github issue #2276)

* Work around a crash bug in g++ 4.4.x by disabling the size reduction setting
  of the module init function in this version.  (Github issue #2235)

* Crash when exceptions occur early during module initialisation.
  (Github issue #2199)


0.28.2 (2018-04-13)
===================

Features added
--------------

* ``abs()`` is faster for Python long objects.

* The C++11 methods ``front()`` and ``end()`` were added to the declaration of
  ``libcpp.string``.  Patch by Alex Huszagh.  (Github issue #2123)

* The C++11 methods ``reserve()`` and ``bucket_count()`` are declared for
  ``libcpp.unordered_map``.  Patch by Valentin Valls.  (Github issue #2168)

Bugs fixed
----------

* The copy of a read-only memoryview was considered read-only as well, whereas
  a common reason to copy a read-only view is to make it writable.  The result
  of the copying is now a writable buffer by default.
  (Github issue #2134)

* The ``switch`` statement generation failed to apply recursively to the body of
  converted if-statements.

* ``NULL`` was sometimes rejected as exception return value when the returned
  type is a fused pointer type.
  Patch by Callie LeFave.  (Github issue #2177)

* Fixed compatibility with PyPy 5.11.
  Patch by Matti Picus.  (Github issue #2165)

Other changes
-------------

* The NumPy tutorial was rewritten to use memoryviews instead of the older
  buffer declaration syntax.
  Contributed by Gabriel de Marmiesse.  (Github issue #2162)


0.28.1 (2018-03-18)
===================

Bugs fixed
----------

* ``PyFrozenSet_New()`` was accidentally used in PyPy where it is missing
  from the C-API.

* Assignment between some C++ templated types were incorrectly rejected
  when the templates mix ``const`` with ``ctypedef``.
  (Github issue #2148)

* Undeclared C++ no-args constructors in subclasses could make the compilation
  fail if the base class constructor was declared without ``nogil``.
  (Github issue #2157)

* Bytes %-formatting inferred ``basestring`` (bytes or unicode) as result type
  in some cases where ``bytes`` would have been safe to infer.
  (Github issue #2153)

* ``None`` was accidentally disallowed as typed return value of ``dict.pop()``.
  (Github issue #2152)


0.28 (2018-03-13)
=================

Features added
--------------

* Cdef classes can now multiply inherit from ordinary Python classes.
  (The primary base must still be a c class, possibly ``object``, and
  the other bases must *not* be cdef classes.)

* Type inference is now supported for Pythran compiled NumPy expressions.
  Patch by Nils Braun.  (Github issue #1954)

* The ``const`` modifier can be applied to memoryview declarations to allow
  read-only buffers as input.  (Github issues #1605, #1869)

* C code in the docstring of a ``cdef extern`` block is copied verbatimly
  into the generated file.
  Patch by Jeroen Demeyer.  (Github issue #1915)

* When compiling with gcc, the module init function is now tuned for small
  code size instead of whatever compile flags were provided externally.
  Cython now also disables some code intensive optimisations in that function
  to further reduce the code size.  (Github issue #2102)

* Decorating an async coroutine with ``@cython.iterable_coroutine`` changes its
  type at compile time to make it iterable.  While this is not strictly in line
  with PEP-492, it improves the interoperability with old-style coroutines that
  use ``yield from`` instead of ``await``.

* The IPython magic has preliminary support for JupyterLab.
  (Github issue #1775)

* The new TSS C-API in CPython 3.7 is supported and has been backported.
  Patch by Naotoshi Seo.  (Github issue #1932)

* Cython knows the new ``Py_tss_t`` type defined in PEP-539 and automatically
  initialises variables declared with that type to ``Py_tss_NEEDS_INIT``,
  a value which cannot be used outside of static assignments.

* The set methods ``.remove()`` and ``.discard()`` are optimised.
  Patch by Antoine Pitrou.  (Github issue #2042)

* ``dict.pop()`` is optimised.
  Original patch by Antoine Pitrou.  (Github issue #2047)

* Iteration over sets and frozensets is optimised.
  (Github issue #2048)

* Safe integer loops (< range(2^30)) are automatically optimised into C loops.

* ``alist.extend([a,b,c])`` is optimised into sequential ``list.append()`` calls
  for short literal sequences.

* Calls to builtin methods that are not specifically optimised into C-API calls
  now use a cache that avoids repeated lookups of the underlying C function.
  (Github issue #2054)

* Single argument function calls can avoid the argument tuple creation in some cases.

* Some redundant extension type checks are avoided.

* Formatting C enum values in f-strings is faster, as well as some other special cases.

* String formatting with the '%' operator is optimised into f-strings in simple cases.

* Subscripting (item access) is faster in some cases.

* Some ``bytearray`` operations have been optimised similar to ``bytes``.

* Some PEP-484/526 container type declarations are now considered for
  loop optimisations.

* Indexing into memoryview slices with ``view[i][j]`` is now optimised into
  ``view[i, j]``.

* Python compatible ``cython.*`` types can now be mixed with type declarations
  in Cython syntax.

* Name lookups in the module and in classes are faster.

* Python attribute lookups on extension types without instance dict are faster.

* Some missing signals were added to ``libc/signal.pxd``.
  Patch by Jeroen Demeyer.  (Github issue #1914)

* The warning about repeated extern declarations is now visible by default.
  (Github issue #1874)

* The exception handling of the function types used by CPython's type slot
  functions was corrected to match the de-facto standard behaviour, so that
  code that uses them directly benefits from automatic and correct exception
  propagation.  Patch by Jeroen Demeyer.  (Github issue #1980)

* Defining the macro ``CYTHON_NO_PYINIT_EXPORT`` will prevent the module init
  function from being exported as symbol, e.g. when linking modules statically
  in an embedding setup.  Patch by AraHaan.  (Github issue #1944)

Bugs fixed
----------

* If a module name is explicitly provided for an ``Extension()`` that is compiled
  via ``cythonize()``, it was previously ignored and replaced by the source file
  name.  It can now be used to override the target module name, e.g. for compiling
  prefixed accelerator modules from Python files.  (Github issue #2038)

* The arguments of the ``num_threads`` parameter of parallel sections
  were not sufficiently validated and could lead to invalid C code.
  (Github issue #1957)

* Catching exceptions with a non-trivial exception pattern could call into
  CPython with a live exception set.  This triggered incorrect behaviour
  and crashes, especially in CPython 3.7.

* The signature of the special ``__richcmp__()`` method was corrected to recognise
  the type of the first argument as ``self``.  It was previously treated as plain
  object, but CPython actually guarantees that it always has the correct type.
  Note: this can change the semantics of user code that previously relied on
  ``self`` being untyped.

* Some Python 3 exceptions were not recognised as builtins when running Cython
  under Python 2.

* Some async helper functions were not defined in the generated C code when
  compiling simple async code.  (Github issue #2075)

* Line tracing did not include generators and coroutines.
  (Github issue #1949)

* C++ declarations for ``unordered_map`` were corrected.
  Patch by Michael Schatzow.  (Github issue #1484)

* Iterator declarations in C++ ``deque`` and ``vector`` were corrected.
  Patch by Alex Huszagh.  (Github issue #1870)

* The const modifiers in the C++ ``string`` declarations were corrected, together
  with the coercion behaviour of string literals into C++ strings.
  (Github issue #2132)

* Some declaration types in ``libc.limits`` were corrected.
  Patch by Jeroen Demeyer.  (Github issue #2016)

* ``@cython.final`` was not accepted on Python classes with an ``@cython.cclass``
  decorator.  (Github issue #2040)

* Cython no longer creates useless and incorrect ``PyInstanceMethod`` wrappers for
  methods in Python 3.  Patch by Jeroen Demeyer.  (Github issue #2105)

* The builtin ``bytearray`` type could not be used as base type of cdef classes.
  (Github issue #2106)

Other changes
-------------


0.27.3 (2017-11-03)
===================

Bugs fixed
----------

* String forward references to extension types like ``@cython.locals(x="ExtType")``
  failed to find the named type.  (Github issue #1962)

* NumPy slicing generated incorrect results when compiled with Pythran.
  Original patch by Serge Guelton (Github issue #1946).

* Fix "undefined reference" linker error for generators on Windows in Py3.3-3.5.
  (Github issue #1968)

* Adapt to recent C-API change of ``PyThreadState`` in CPython 3.7.

* Fix signature of ``PyWeakref_GetObject()`` API declaration.
  Patch by Jeroen Demeyer (Github issue #1975).


0.27.2 (2017-10-22)
===================

Bugs fixed
----------

* Comprehensions could incorrectly be optimised away when they appeared in boolean
  test contexts.  (Github issue #1920)

* The special methods ``__eq__``, ``__lt__`` etc. in extension types did not type
  their first argument as the type of the class but ``object``.  (Github issue #1935)

* Crash on first lookup of "cline_in_traceback" option during exception handling.
  (Github issue #1907)

* Some nested module level comprehensions failed to compile.
  (Github issue #1906)

* Compiler crash on some complex type declarations in pure mode.
  (Github issue #1908)

* ``std::unordered_map.erase()`` was declared with an incorrect ``void`` return
  type in ``libcpp.unordered_map``.  (Github issue #1484)

* Invalid use of C++ ``fallthrough`` attribute before C++11 and similar issue in clang.
  (Github issue #1930)

* Compiler crash on misnamed properties. (Github issue #1905)


0.27.1 (2017-10-01)
===================

Features added
--------------

* The Jupyter magic has a new debug option ``--verbose`` that shows details about
  the distutils invocation.  Patch by Boris Filippov (Github issue #1881).

Bugs fixed
----------

* Py3 list comprehensions in class bodies resulted in invalid C code.
  (Github issue #1889)

* Modules built for later CPython 3.5.x versions failed to import in 3.5.0/3.5.1.
  (Github issue #1880)

* Deallocating fused types functions and methods kept their GC tracking enabled,
  which could potentially lead to recursive deallocation attempts.

* Crash when compiling in C++ mode with old setuptools versions.
  (Github issue #1879)

* C++ object arguments for the constructor of Cython implemented C++ are now
  passed by reference and not by value to allow for non-copyable arguments, such
  as ``unique_ptr``.

* API-exported C++ classes with Python object members failed to compile.
  (Github issue #1866)

* Some issues with the new relaxed exception value handling were resolved.

* Python classes as annotation types could prevent compilation.
  (Github issue #1887)

* Cython annotation types in Python files could lead to import failures
  with a "cython undefined" error.  Recognised types are now turned into strings.

* Coverage analysis could fail to report on extension modules on some platforms.

* Annotations could be parsed (and rejected) as types even with
  ``annotation_typing=False``.

Other changes
-------------

* PEP 489 support has been disabled by default to counter incompatibilities with
  import setups that try to reload or reinitialise modules.


0.27 (2017-09-23)
=================

Features added
--------------

* Extension module initialisation follows
  `PEP 489 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0489/>`_ in CPython 3.5+, which
  resolves several differences with regard to normal Python modules.  This makes
  the global names ``__file__`` and ``__path__`` correctly available to module
  level code and improves the support for module-level relative imports.
  (Github issues #1715, #1753, #1035)

* Asynchronous generators (`PEP 525 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0525/>`_)
  and asynchronous comprehensions (`PEP 530 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0530/>`_)
  have been implemented.  Note that async generators require finalisation support
  in order to allow for asynchronous operations during cleanup, which is only
  available in CPython 3.6+.  All other functionality has been backported as usual.

* Variable annotations are now parsed according to
  `PEP 526 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0526/>`_.  Cython types (e.g.
  ``cython.int``) are evaluated as C type declarations and everything else as Python
  types.  This can be disabled with the directive ``annotation_typing=False``.
  Note that most complex PEP-484 style annotations are currently ignored.  This will
  change in future releases. (Github issue #1850)

* Extension types (also in pure Python mode) can implement the normal special methods
  ``__eq__``, ``__lt__`` etc. for comparisons instead of the low-level ``__richcmp__``
  method.  (Github issue #690)

* New decorator ``@cython.exceptval(x=None, check=False)`` that makes the signature
  declarations ``except x``, ``except? x`` and ``except *`` available to pure Python
  code.  Original patch by Antonio Cuni.  (Github issue #1653)

* Signature annotations are now included in the signature docstring generated by
  the ``embedsignature`` directive.  Patch by Lisandro Dalcin (Github issue #1781).

* The gdb support for Python code (``libpython.py``) was updated to the latest
  version in CPython 3.7 (git rev 5fe59f8).

* The compiler tries to find a usable exception return value for cdef functions
  with ``except *`` if the returned type allows it.  Note that this feature is subject
  to safety limitations, so it is still better to provide an explicit declaration.

* C functions can be assigned to function pointers with a compatible exception
  declaration, not only with exact matches.  A side-effect is that certain compatible
  signature overrides are now allowed and some more mismatches of exception signatures
  are now detected and rejected as errors that were not detected before.

* The IPython/Jupyter magic integration has a new option ``%%cython --pgo`` for profile
  guided optimisation. It compiles the cell with PGO settings for the C compiler,
  executes it to generate a runtime profile, and then compiles it again using that
  profile for C compiler optimisation.  Currently only tested with gcc.

* ``len(memoryview)`` can be used in nogil sections to get the size of the
  first dimension of a memory view (``shape[0]``). (Github issue #1733)

* C++ classes can now contain (properly refcounted) Python objects.

* NumPy dtype subarrays are now accessible through the C-API.
  Patch by Gerald Dalley (Github issue #245).

* Resolves several issues with PyPy and uses faster async slots in PyPy3.
  Patch by Ronan Lamy (Github issues #1871, #1878).

Bugs fixed
----------

* Extension types that were cimported from other Cython modules could disagree
  about the order of fused cdef methods in their call table.  This could lead
  to wrong methods being called and potentially also crashes.  The fix required
  changes to the ordering of fused methods in the call table, which may break
  existing compiled modules that call fused cdef methods across module boundaries,
  if these methods were implemented in a different order than they were declared
  in the corresponding .pxd file. (Github issue #1873)

* The exception state handling in generators and coroutines could lead to
  exceptions in the caller being lost if an exception was raised and handled
  inside of the coroutine when yielding. (Github issue #1731)

* Loops over ``range(enum)`` were not converted into C for-loops.  Note that it
  is still recommended to use an explicit cast to a C integer type in this case.

* Error positions of names (e.g. variables) were incorrectly reported after the
  name and not at the beginning of the name.

* Compile time ``DEF`` assignments were evaluated even when they occur inside of
  falsy ``IF`` blocks. (Github issue #1796)

* Disabling the line tracing from a trace function could fail.
  Original patch by Dmitry Trofimov. (Github issue #1769)

* Several issues with the Pythran integration were resolved.

* abs(signed int) now returns a signed rather than unsigned int.
  (Github issue #1837)

* Reading ``frame.f_locals`` of a Cython function (e.g. from a debugger or profiler
  could modify the module globals. (Github issue #1836)

* Buffer type mismatches in the NumPy buffer support could leak a reference to the
  buffer owner.

* Using the "is_f_contig" and "is_c_contig" memoryview methods together could leave
  one of them undeclared. (Github issue #1872)

* Compilation failed if the for-in-range loop target was not a variable but a more
  complex expression, e.g. an item assignment. (Github issue #1831)

* Compile time evaluations of (partially) constant f-strings could show incorrect
  results.

* Escape sequences in raw f-strings (``fr'...'``) were resolved instead of passing
  them through as expected.

* Some ref-counting issues in buffer error handling have been resolved.

Other changes
-------------

* Type declarations in signature annotations are now parsed according to
  `PEP 484 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/>`_
  typing.  Only Cython types (e.g. ``cython.int``) and Python builtin types are
  currently considered as type declarations.  Everything else is ignored, but this
  will change in a future Cython release.
  (Github issue #1672)

* The directive ``annotation_typing`` is now ``True`` by default, which enables
  parsing type declarations from annotations.

* This release no longer supports Python 3.2.


0.26.1 (2017-08-29)
===================

Features added
--------------

Bugs fixed
----------

* ``cython.view.array`` was missing ``.__len__()``.

* Extension types with a ``.pxd`` override for their ``__releasebuffer__`` slot
  (e.g. as provided by Cython for the Python ``array.array`` type) could leak
  a reference to the buffer owner on release, thus not freeing the memory.
  (Github issue #1638)

* Auto-decoding failed in 0.26 for strings inside of C++ containers.
  (Github issue #1790)

* Compile error when inheriting from C++ container types.
  (Github issue #1788)

* Invalid C code in generators (declaration after code).
  (Github issue #1801)

* Arithmetic operations on ``const`` integer variables could generate invalid code.
  (Github issue #1798)

* Local variables with names of special Python methods failed to compile inside of
  closures. (Github issue #1797)

* Problem with indirect Emacs buffers in cython-mode.
  Patch by Martin Albrecht (Github issue #1743).

* Extension types named ``result`` or ``PickleError`` generated invalid unpickling code.
  Patch by Jason Madden (Github issue #1786).

* Bazel integration failed to compile ``.py`` files.
  Patch by Guro Bokum (Github issue #1784).

* Some include directories and dependencies were referenced with their absolute paths
  in the generated files despite lying within the project directory.

* Failure to compile in Py3.7 due to a modified signature of ``_PyCFunctionFast()``


0.26 (2017-07-19)
=================

Features added
--------------

* Pythran can be used as a backend for evaluating NumPy array expressions.
  Patch by Adrien Guinet (Github issue #1607).

* cdef classes now support pickling by default when possible.
  This can be disabled with the ``auto_pickle`` directive.

* Speed up comparisons of strings if their hash value is available.
  Patch by Claudio Freire (Github issue #1571).

* Support pyximport from zip files.
  Patch by Sergei Lebedev (Github issue #1485).

* IPython magic now respects the ``__all__`` variable and ignores
  names with leading-underscore (like ``import *`` does).
  Patch by Syrtis Major (Github issue #1625).

* ``abs()`` is optimised for C complex numbers.
  Patch by David Woods (Github issue #1648).

* The display of C lines in Cython tracebacks can now be enabled at runtime
  via ``import cython_runtime; cython_runtime.cline_in_traceback=True``.
  The default has been changed to False.

* The overhead of calling fused types generic functions was reduced.

* "cdef extern" include files are now also searched relative to the current file.
  Patch by Jeroen Demeyer (Github issue #1654).

* Optional optimization for re-acquiring the GIL, controlled by the
  `fast_gil` directive.

Bugs fixed
----------

* Item lookup/assignment with a unicode character as index that is typed
  (explicitly or implicitly) as ``Py_UCS4`` or ``Py_UNICODE`` used the
  integer value instead of the Unicode string value. Code that relied on
  the previous behaviour now triggers a warning that can be disabled by
  applying an explicit cast. (Github issue #1602)

* f-string processing was adapted to changes in PEP 498 and CPython 3.6.

* Invalid C code when decoding from UTF-16(LE/BE) byte strings.
  (Github issue #1696)

* Unicode escapes in 'ur' raw-unicode strings were not resolved in Py2 code.
  Original patch by Aaron Gallagher (Github issue #1594).

* File paths of code objects are now relative.
  Original patch by Jelmer Vernooij (Github issue #1565).

* Decorators of cdef class methods could be executed twice.
  Patch by Jeroen Demeyer (Github issue #1724).

* Dict iteration using the Py2 ``iter*`` methods failed in PyPy3.
  Patch by Armin Rigo (Github issue #1631).

* Several warnings in the generated code are now suppressed.

Other changes
-------------

* The ``unraisable_tracebacks`` option now defaults to ``True``.

* Coercion of C++ containers to Python is no longer automatic on attribute
  access (Github issue #1521).

* Access to Python attributes of cimported modules without the corresponding
  import is now a compile-time (rather than runtime) error.

* Do not use special dll linkage for "cdef public" functions.
  Patch by Jeroen Demeyer (Github issue #1687).

* cdef/cpdef methods must match their declarations.  See Github Issue #1732.
  This is now a warning and will be an error in future releases.


0.25.2 (2016-12-08)
===================

Bugs fixed
----------

* Fixes several issues with C++ template deduction.

* Fixes a issue with bound method type inference (Github issue #551).

* Fixes a bug with cascaded tuple assignment (Github issue #1523).

* Fixed or silenced many Clang warnings.

* Fixes bug with powers of pure real complex numbers (Github issue #1538).


0.25.1 (2016-10-26)
===================

Bugs fixed
----------

* Fixes a bug with ``isinstance(o, Exception)`` (Github issue #1496).

* Fixes bug with ``cython.view.array`` missing utility code in some cases
  (Github issue #1502).

* The distutils extension ``Cython.Distutils.build_ext`` has been reverted,
  temporarily, to be ``old_build_ext`` to give projects time to migrate.
  The new build_ext is available as ``new_build_ext``.


0.25 (2016-10-25)
=================

Features added
--------------

* def/cpdef methods of cdef classes benefit from Cython's internal function
  implementation, which enables introspection and line profiling for them.
  Implementation sponsored by Turbostream (www.turbostream-cfd.com).

* Calls to Python functions are faster, following the recent "FastCall"
  optimisations that Victor Stinner implemented for CPython 3.6.
  See https://bugs.python.org/issue27128 and related issues.

* The new METH_FASTCALL calling convention for PyCFunctions is supported
  in CPython 3.6.  See https://bugs.python.org/issue27810

* Initial support for using Cython modules in Pyston.
  Patch by Boxiang Sun.

* Dynamic Python attributes are allowed on cdef classes if an attribute
  ``cdef dict __dict__`` is declared in the class.  Patch by empyrical.

* Cython implemented C++ classes can make direct calls to base class methods.
  Patch by empyrical.

* C++ classes can now have typedef members. STL containers updated with
  value_type.

* New directive ``cython.no_gc`` to fully disable GC for a cdef class.
  Patch by Claudio Freire.

* Buffer variables are no longer excluded from ``locals()``.
  Patch by David Woods.

* Building f-strings is faster, especially when formatting C integers.

* for-loop iteration over "std::string".

* ``libc/math.pxd`` provides ``e`` and ``pi`` as alias constants to simplify
  usage as a drop-in replacement for Python's math module.

* Speed up cython.inline().

* Binary lshift operations with small constant Python integers are faster.

* Some integer operations on Python long objects are faster in Python 2.7.

* Support for the C++ ``typeid`` operator.

* Support for bazel using a the pyx_library rule in //Tools:rules.bzl.

Significant Bugs fixed
----------------------

* Division of complex numbers avoids overflow by using Smith's method.

* Some function signatures in ``libc.math`` and ``numpy.pxd`` were incorrect.
  Patch by Michael Seifert.

Other changes
-------------

* The "%%cython" IPython/jupyter magic now defaults to the language level of
  the current jupyter kernel.  The language level can be set explicitly with
  "%%cython -2" or "%%cython -3".

* The distutils extension ``Cython.Distutils.build_ext`` has now been updated
  to use cythonize which properly handles dependencies.  The old extension can
  still be found in ``Cython.Distutils.old_build_ext`` and is now deprecated.

* ``directive_defaults`` is no longer available in ``Cython.Compiler.Options``,
  use ``get_directive_defaults()`` instead.


0.24.1 (2016-07-15)
===================

Bugs fixed
----------

* IPython cell magic was lacking a good way to enable Python 3 code semantics.
  It can now be used as "%%cython -3".

* Follow a recent change in `PEP 492 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0492/>`_
  and CPython 3.5.2 that now requires the ``__aiter__()`` method of asynchronous
  iterators to be a simple ``def`` method instead of an ``async def`` method.

* Coroutines and generators were lacking the ``__module__`` special attribute.

* C++ ``std::complex`` values failed to auto-convert from and to Python complex
  objects.

* Namespaced C++ types could not be used as memory view types due to lack of
  name mangling.  Patch by Ivan Smirnov.

* Assignments between identical C++ types that were declared with differently
  typedefed template types could fail.

* Rebuilds could fail to evaluate dependency timestamps in C++ mode.
  Patch by Ian Henriksen.

* Macros defined in the ``distutils`` compiler option do not require values
  anymore.  Patch by Ian Henriksen.

* Minor fixes for MSVC, Cygwin and PyPy.


0.24 (2016-04-04)
=================

Features added
--------------

* `PEP 498 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/>`_:
  Literal String Formatting (f-strings).
  Original patch by Jelle Zijlstra.

* `PEP 515 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0515/>`_:
  Underscores as visual separators in number literals.

* Parser was adapted to some minor syntax changes in Py3.6, e.g.
  https://bugs.python.org/issue9232

* The embedded C code comments that show the original source code
  can be discarded with the new directive ``emit_code_comments=False``.

* Cpdef enums are now first-class iterable, callable types in Python.

* Ctuples can now be declared in pure Python code.

* Posix declarations for DLL loading and stdio extensions were added.
  Patch by Lars Buitinck.

* The Py2-only builtins ``unicode()``, ``xrange()``, ``reduce()`` and
  ``long`` are now also available in compile time ``DEF`` expressions
  when compiling with Py3.

* Exception type tests have slightly lower overhead.
  This fixes ticket 868.

* @property syntax fully supported in cdef classes, old syntax deprecated.

* C++ classes can now be declared with default template parameters.

Bugs fixed
----------

* C++ exceptions raised by overloaded C++ operators were not always
  handled.  Patch by Ian Henriksen.

* C string literals were previously always stored as non-const global
  variables in the module.  They are now stored as global constants
  when possible, and otherwise as non-const C string literals in the
  generated code that uses them.  This improves compatibility with
  strict C compiler options and prevents non-const strings literals
  with the same content from being incorrectly merged.

* Compile time evaluated ``str`` expressions (``DEF``) now behave in a
  more useful way by turning into Unicode strings when compiling under
  Python 3.  This allows using them as intermediate values in expressions.
  Previously, they always evaluated to bytes objects.

* ``isinf()`` declarations in ``libc/math.pxd`` and ``numpy/math.pxd`` now
  reflect the actual tristate ``int`` return value instead of using ``bint``.

* Literal assignments to ctuples avoid Python tuple round-trips in some
  more corner cases.

* Iteration over ``dict(...).items()`` failed to get optimised when dict
  arguments included keyword arguments.

* cProfile now correctly profiles cpdef functions and methods.


0.23.5 (2016-03-26)
===================

* Compile errors and warnings in integer type conversion code.  This fixes
  ticket 877.  Patches by Christian Neukirchen, Nikolaus Rath, Ian Henriksen.

* Reference leak when ``*args`` argument was reassigned in closures.

* Truth-testing Unicode strings could waste time and memory in Py3.3+.

* Return values of async functions could be ignored and replaced by ``None``.

* Compiler crash in CPython 3.6.

* Fix prange() to behave identically to range().  The end condition was
  miscalculated when the range was not exactly divisible by the step.

* Optimised ``all(genexpr)``/``any(genexpr)`` calls could warn about unused
  code.  This fixes ticket 876.


0.23.4 (2015-10-10)
===================

Bugs fixed
----------

* Memory leak when calling Python functions in PyPy.

* Compilation problem with MSVC in C99-ish mode.

* Warning about unused values in a helper macro.


0.23.3 (2015-09-29)
===================

Bugs fixed
----------

* Invalid C code for some builtin methods.  This fixes ticket 856 again.

* Incorrect C code in helper functions for PyLong conversion and string
  decoding.  This fixes ticket 863, ticket 864 and ticket 865.
  Original patch by Nikolaus Rath.

* Large folded or inserted integer constants could use too small C
  integer types and thus trigger a value wrap-around.

Other changes
-------------

* The coroutine and generator types of Cython now also register directly
  with the ``Coroutine`` and ``Generator`` ABCs in the ``backports_abc``
  module if it can be imported.  This fixes ticket 870.


0.23.2 (2015-09-11)
===================

Bugs fixed
----------

* Compiler crash when analysing some optimised expressions.

* Coverage plugin was adapted to coverage.py 4.0 beta 2.

* C++ destructor calls could fail when '&' operator is overwritten.

* Incorrect C literal generation for large integers in compile-time
  evaluated DEF expressions and constant folded expressions.

* Byte string constants could end up as Unicode strings when originating
  from compile-time evaluated DEF expressions.

* Invalid C code when caching known builtin methods.
  This fixes ticket 860.

* ``ino_t`` in ``posix.types`` was not declared as ``unsigned``.

* Declarations in ``libcpp/memory.pxd`` were missing ``operator!()``.
  Patch by Leo Razoumov.

* Static cdef methods can now be declared in .pxd files.


0.23.1 (2015-08-22)
===================

Bugs fixed
----------

* Invalid C code for generators.  This fixes ticket 858.

* Invalid C code for some builtin methods.  This fixes ticket 856.

* Invalid C code for unused local buffer variables.
  This fixes ticket 154.

* Test failures on 32bit systems.  This fixes ticket 857.

* Code that uses ``from xyz import *`` and global C struct/union/array
  variables could fail to compile due to missing helper functions.
  This fixes ticket 851.

* Misnamed PEP 492 coroutine property ``cr_yieldfrom`` renamed to
  ``cr_await`` to match CPython.

* Missing deallocation code for C++ object attributes in certain
  extension class hierarchies.

* Crash when async coroutine was not awaited.

* Compiler crash on ``yield`` in signature annotations and default
  argument values.  Both are forbidden now.

* Compiler crash on certain constructs in ``finally`` clauses.

* Cython failed to build when CPython's pgen is installed.


0.23 (2015-08-08)
=================

Features added
--------------

* `PEP 492 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0492/>`_
  (async/await) was implemented.

* `PEP 448 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0448/>`_
  (Additional Unpacking Generalizations) was implemented.

* Support for coverage.py 4.0+ can be enabled by adding the plugin
  "Cython.Coverage" to the ".coveragerc" config file.

* Annotated HTML source pages can integrate (XML) coverage reports.

* Tracing is supported in ``nogil`` functions/sections and module init code.

* When generators are used in a Cython module and the module imports the
  modules "inspect" and/or "asyncio", Cython enables interoperability by
  patching these modules during the import to recognise Cython's internal
  generator and coroutine types. This can be disabled by C compiling the
  module with "-D CYTHON_PATCH_ASYNCIO=0" or "-D CYTHON_PATCH_INSPECT=0"

* When generators or coroutines are used in a Cython module, their types
  are registered with the ``Generator`` and ``Coroutine`` ABCs in the
  ``collections`` or ``collections.abc`` stdlib module at import time to
  enable interoperability with code that needs to detect and process Python
  generators/coroutines.  These ABCs were added in CPython 3.5 and are
  available for older Python versions through the ``backports_abc`` module
  on PyPI.  See https://bugs.python.org/issue24018

* Adding/subtracting/dividing/modulus and equality comparisons with
  constant Python floats and small integers are faster.

* Binary and/or/xor/rshift operations with small constant Python integers
  are faster.

* When called on generator expressions, the builtins ``all()``, ``any()``,
  ``dict()``, ``list()``, ``set()``, ``sorted()`` and ``unicode.join()``
  avoid the generator iteration overhead by inlining a part of their
  functionality into the for-loop.

* Keyword argument dicts are no longer copied on function entry when they
  are not being used or only passed through to other function calls (e.g.
  in wrapper functions).

* The ``PyTypeObject`` declaration in ``cpython.object`` was extended.

* The builtin ``type`` type is now declared as PyTypeObject in source,
  allowing for extern functions taking type parameters to have the correct
  C signatures.  Note that this might break code that uses ``type`` just
  for passing around Python types in typed variables.  Removing the type
  declaration provides a backwards compatible fix.

* ``wraparound()`` and ``boundscheck()`` are available as no-ops in pure
  Python mode.

* Const iterators were added to the provided C++ STL declarations.

* Smart pointers were added to the provided C++ STL declarations.
  Patch by Daniel Filonik.

* ``NULL`` is allowed as default argument when embedding signatures.
  This fixes ticket 843.

* When compiling with ``--embed``, the internal module name is changed to
  ``__main__`` to allow arbitrary program names, including those that would
  be invalid for modules.  Note that this prevents reuse of the generated
  C code as an importable module.

* External C++ classes that overload the assignment operator can be used.
  Patch by Ian Henriksen.

* Support operator bool() for C++ classes so they can be used in if statements.

Bugs fixed
----------

* Calling "yield from" from Python on a Cython generator that returned a
  value triggered a crash in CPython.  This is now being worked around.
  See https://bugs.python.org/issue23996

* Language level 3 did not enable true division (a.k.a. float division)
  for integer operands.

* Functions with fused argument types that included a generic 'object'
  fallback could end up using that fallback also for other explicitly
  listed object types.

* Relative cimports could accidentally fall back to trying an absolute
  cimport on failure.

* The result of calling a C struct constructor no longer requires an
  intermediate assignment when coercing to a Python dict.

* C++ exception declarations with mapping functions could fail to compile
  when pre-declared in .pxd files.

* ``cpdef void`` methods are now permitted.

* ``abs(cint)`` could fail to compile in MSVC and used sub-optimal code
  in C++.  Patch by David Vierra, original patch by Michael Enßlin.

* Buffer index calculations using index variables with small C integer
  types could overflow for large buffer sizes.
  Original patch by David Vierra.

* C unions use a saner way to coerce from and to Python dicts.

* When compiling a module ``foo.pyx``, the directories in ``sys.path``
  are no longer searched when looking for ``foo.pxd``.
  Patch by Jeroen Demeyer.

* Memory leaks in the embedding main function were fixed.
  Original patch by Michael Enßlin.

* Some complex Python expressions could fail to compile inside of finally
  clauses.

* Unprefixed 'str' literals were not supported as C varargs arguments.

* Fixed type errors in conversion enum types to/from Python.  Note that
  this imposes stricter correctness requirements on enum declarations.


Other changes
-------------

* Changed mangling scheme in header files generated by ``cdef api``
  declarations.

* Installation under CPython 3.3+ no longer requires a pass of the
  2to3 tool.  This also makes it possible to run Cython in Python
  3.3+ from a source checkout without installing it first.
  Patch by Petr Viktorin.

* ``jedi-typer.py`` (in ``Tools/``) was extended and renamed to
  ``jedityper.py`` (to make it importable) and now works with and
  requires Jedi 0.9.  Patch by Tzer-jen Wei.


0.22.1 (2015-06-20)
===================

Bugs fixed
----------

* Crash when returning values on generator termination.

* In some cases, exceptions raised during internal isinstance() checks were
  not propagated.

* Runtime reported file paths of source files (e.g for profiling and tracing)
  are now relative to the build root directory instead of the main source file.

* Tracing exception handling code could enter the trace function with an active
  exception set.

* The internal generator function type was not shared across modules.

* Comparisons of (inferred) ctuples failed to compile.

* Closures inside of cdef functions returning ``void`` failed to compile.

* Using ``const`` C++ references in intermediate parts of longer expressions
  could fail to compile.

* C++ exception declarations with mapping functions could fail to compile when
  pre-declared in .pxd files.

* C++ compilation could fail with an ambiguity error in recent MacOS-X Xcode
  versions.

* C compilation could fail in pypy3.

* Fixed a memory leak in the compiler when compiling multiple modules.

* When compiling multiple modules, external library dependencies could leak
  into later compiler runs.  Fix by Jeroen Demeyer.  This fixes ticket 845.


0.22 (2015-02-11)
=================

Features added
--------------

* C functions can coerce to Python functions, which allows passing them
  around as callable objects.

* C arrays can be assigned by value and auto-coerce from Python iterables
  and to Python lists (and tuples).

* Extern C functions can now be declared as cpdef to export them to
  the module's Python namespace.  Extern C functions in pxd files export
  their values to their own module, iff it exists.

* Anonymous C tuple types can be declared as (ctype1, ctype2, ...).

* `PEP 479 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0479/>`_:
  turn accidental StopIteration exceptions that exit generators
  into a RuntimeError, activated with future import "generator_stop".

* Looping over ``reversed(range())`` is optimised in the same way as
  ``range()``.  Patch by Favian Contreras.

Bugs fixed
----------

* Mismatching 'except' declarations on signatures in .pxd and .pyx files failed
  to produce a compile error.

* Failure to find any files for the path pattern(s) passed into ``cythonize()``
  is now an error to more easily detect accidental typos.

* The ``logaddexp`` family of functions in ``numpy.math`` now has correct
  declarations.

* In Py2.6/7 and Py3.2, simple Cython memory views could accidentally be
  interpreted as non-contiguous by CPython, which could trigger a CPython
  bug when copying data from them, thus leading to data corruption.
  See CPython issues 12834 and 23349.

Other changes
-------------

* Preliminary support for defining the Cython language with a formal grammar.
  To try parsing your files against this grammar, use the --formal_grammar directive.
  Experimental.

* ``_`` is no longer considered a cacheable builtin as it could interfere with
  gettext.

* Cythonize-computed metadata now cached in the generated C files.

* Several corrections and extensions in numpy, cpython, and libcpp pxd files.


0.21.2 (2014-12-27)
===================

Bugs fixed
----------

* Crash when assigning a C value to both a Python and C target at the same time.

* Automatic coercion from C++ strings to ``str`` generated incomplete code that
  failed to compile.

* Declaring a constructor in a C++ child class erroneously required a default
  constructor declaration in the super class.

* ``resize_smart()`` in ``cpython.array`` was broken.

* Functions in ``libcpp.cast`` are now declared as ``nogil``.

* Some missing C-API declarations were added.

* Py3 main code in embedding program code was lacking casts.

* Exception related to distutils "Distribution" class type in pyximport under
  latest CPython 2.7 and 3.4 releases when setuptools is being imported later.


0.21.1 (2014-10-18)
===================

Features added
--------------

* New ``cythonize`` option ``-a`` to generate the annotated HTML source view.

* Missing C-API declarations in ``cpython.unicode`` were added.

* Passing ``language='c++'`` into cythonize() globally enables C++ mode for
  all modules that were not passed as Extension objects (i.e. only source
  files and file patterns).

* ``Py_hash_t`` is a known type (used in CPython for hash values).

* ``PySlice_*()`` C-API functions are available from the ``cpython.slice``
  module.

* Allow arrays of C++ classes.

Bugs fixed
----------

* Reference leak for non-simple Python expressions in boolean and/or expressions.

* To fix a name collision and to reflect availability on host platforms,
  standard C declarations [ clock(), time(), struct tm and tm* functions ]
  were moved from posix/time.pxd to a new libc/time.pxd.  Patch by Charles
  Blake.

* Rerunning unmodified modules in IPython's cython support failed.
  Patch by Matthias Bussonier.

* Casting C++ ``std::string`` to Python byte strings failed when
  auto-decoding was enabled.

* Fatal exceptions in global module init code could lead to crashes
  if the already created module was used later on (e.g. through a
  stale reference in sys.modules or elsewhere).

* ``cythonize.py`` script was not installed on MS-Windows.

Other changes
-------------

* Compilation no longer fails hard when unknown compilation options are
  passed.  Instead, it raises a warning and ignores them (as it did silently
  before 0.21).  This will be changed back to an error in a future release.


0.21 (2014-09-10)
=================

Features added
--------------

* C (cdef) functions allow inner Python functions.

* Enums can now be declared as cpdef to export their values to
  the module's Python namespace.  Cpdef enums in pxd files export
  their values to their own module, iff it exists.

* Allow @staticmethod decorator to declare static cdef methods.
  This is especially useful for declaring "constructors" for
  cdef classes that can take non-Python arguments.

* Taking a ``char*`` from a temporary Python string object is safer
  in more cases and can be done inside of non-trivial expressions,
  including arguments of a function call.  A compile time error
  is raised only when such a pointer is assigned to a variable and
  would thus exceed the lifetime of the string itself.

* Generators have new properties ``__name__`` and ``__qualname__``
  that provide the plain/qualified name of the generator function
  (following CPython 3.5).  See https://bugs.python.org/issue21205

* The ``inline`` function modifier is available as a decorator
  ``@cython.inline`` in pure mode.

* When cygdb is run in a virtualenv, it enables the same virtualenv
  inside of the debugger. Patch by Marc Abramowitz.

* PEP 465: dedicated infix operator for matrix multiplication (A @ B).

* HTML output of annotated code uses Pygments for code highlighting
  and generally received a major overhaul by Matthias Bussonier.

* IPython magic support is now available directly from Cython with
  the command "%load_ext cython".  Cython code can directly be
  executed in a cell when marked with "%%cython".  Code analysis
  is available with "%%cython -a".  Patch by Martín Gaitán.

* Simple support for declaring Python object types in Python signature
  annotations.  Currently requires setting the compiler directive
  ``annotation_typing=True``.

* New directive ``use_switch`` (defaults to True) to optionally disable
  the optimization of chained if statement to C switch statements.

* Defines dynamic_cast et al. in ``libcpp.cast`` and C++ heap data
  structure operations in ``libcpp.algorithm``.

* Shipped header declarations in ``posix.*`` were extended to cover
  more of the POSIX API.  Patches by Lars Buitinck and Mark Peek.

Optimizations
-------------

* Simple calls to C implemented Python functions/methods are faster.
  This also speeds up many operations on builtins that Cython cannot
  otherwise optimise.

* The "and"/"or" operators try to avoid unnecessary coercions of their
  arguments.  They now evaluate the truth value of each argument
  independently and only coerce the final result of the whole expression
  to the target type (e.g. the type on the left side of an assignment).
  This also avoids reference counting overhead for Python values during
  evaluation and generally improves the code flow in the generated C code.

* The Python expression "2 ** N" is optimised into bit shifting.
  See https://bugs.python.org/issue21420

* Cascaded assignments (a = b = ...) try to minimise the number of
  type coercions.

* Calls to ``slice()`` are translated to a straight C-API call.

Bugs fixed
----------

* Crash when assigning memory views from ternary conditional expressions.

* Nested C++ templates could lead to unseparated ">>" characters being
  generated into the C++ declarations, which older C++ compilers could
  not parse.

* Sending SIGINT (Ctrl-C) during parallel cythonize() builds could
  hang the child processes.

* No longer ignore local setup.cfg files for distutils in pyximport.
  Patch by Martin Teichmann.

* Taking a ``char*`` from an indexed Python string generated unsafe
  reference counting code.

* Set literals now create all of their items before trying to add them
  to the set, following the behaviour in CPython.  This makes a
  difference in the rare case that the item creation has side effects
  and some items are not hashable (or if hashing them has side effects,
  too).

* Cython no longer generates the cross product of C functions for code
  that uses memory views of fused types in function signatures (e.g.
  ``cdef func(floating[:] a, floating[:] b)``).  This is considered the
  expected behaviour by most users and was previously inconsistent with
  other structured types like C arrays.  Code that really wants all type
  combinations can create the same fused memoryview type under different
  names and use those in the signature to make it clear which types are
  independent.

* Names that were unknown at compile time were looked up as builtins at
  runtime but not as global module names.  Trying both lookups helps with
  globals() manipulation.

* Fixed stl container conversion for typedef element types.

* ``obj.pop(x)`` truncated large C integer values of x to ``Py_ssize_t``.

* ``__init__.pyc`` is recognised as marking a package directory
  (in addition to .py, .pyx and .pxd).

* Syntax highlighting in ``cython-mode.el`` for Emacs no longer
  incorrectly highlights keywords found as part of longer names.

* Correctly handle ``from cython.submodule cimport name``.

* Fix infinite recursion when using super with cpdef methods.

* No-args ``dir()`` was not guaranteed to return a sorted list.

Other changes
-------------

* The header line in the generated C files no longer contains the
  timestamp but only the Cython version that wrote it.  This was
  changed to make builds more reproducible.

* Removed support for CPython 2.4, 2.5 and 3.1.

* The licensing implications on the generated code were clarified
  to avoid legal constraints for users.


0.20.2 (2014-06-16)
===================

Features added
--------------

* Some optimisations for set/frozenset instantiation.

* Support for C++ unordered_set and unordered_map.

Bugs fixed
----------

* Access to attributes of optimised builtin methods (e.g.
  ``[].append.__name__``) could fail to compile.

* Memory leak when extension subtypes add a memory view as attribute
  to those of the parent type without having Python object attributes
  or a user provided dealloc method.

* Compiler crash on readonly properties in "binding" mode.

* Auto-encoding with ``c_string_encoding=ascii`` failed in Py3.3.

* Crash when subtyping freelist enabled Cython extension types with
  Python classes that use ``__slots__``.

* Freelist usage is restricted to CPython to avoid problems with other
  Python implementations.

* Memory leak in memory views when copying overlapping, contiguous slices.

* Format checking when requesting non-contiguous buffers from
  ``cython.array`` objects was accidentally omitted in Py3.

* C++ destructor calls in extension types could fail to compile in clang.

* Buffer format validation failed for sequences of strings in structs.

* Docstrings on extension type attributes in .pxd files were rejected.


0.20.1 (2014-02-11)
===================

Bugs fixed
----------

* Build error under recent MacOS-X versions where ``isspace()`` could not be
  resolved by clang.

* List/Tuple literals multiplied by more than one factor were only multiplied
  by the last factor instead of all.

* Lookups of special methods (specifically for context managers) could fail
  in Python <= 2.6/3.1.

* Local variables were erroneously appended to the signature introspection
  of Cython implemented functions with keyword-only arguments under Python 3.

* In-place assignments to variables with inferred Python builtin/extension
  types could fail with type errors if the result value type was incompatible
  with the type of the previous value.

* The C code generation order of cdef classes, closures, helper code,
  etc. was not deterministic, thus leading to high code churn.

* Type inference could fail to deduce C enum types.

* Type inference could deduce unsafe or inefficient types from integer
  assignments within a mix of inferred Python variables and integer
  variables.


0.20 (2014-01-18)
=================

Features added
--------------

* Support for CPython 3.4.

* Support for calling C++ template functions.

* ``yield`` is supported in ``finally`` clauses.

* The C code generated for finally blocks is duplicated for each exit
  case to allow for better optimisations by the C compiler.

* Cython tries to undo the Python optimisationism of assigning a bound
  method to a local variable when it can generate better code for the
  direct call.

* Constant Python float values are cached.

* String equality comparisons can use faster type specific code in
  more cases than before.

* String/Unicode formatting using the '%' operator uses a faster
  C-API call.

* ``bytearray`` has become a known type and supports coercion from and
  to C strings.  Indexing, slicing and decoding is optimised. Note that
  this may have an impact on existing code due to type inference.

* Using ``cdef basestring stringvar`` and function arguments typed as
  ``basestring`` is now meaningful and allows assigning exactly
  ``str`` and ``unicode`` objects, but no subtypes of these types.

* Support for the ``__debug__`` builtin.

* Assertions in Cython compiled modules are disabled if the running
  Python interpreter was started with the "-O" option.

* Some types that Cython provides internally, such as functions and
  generators, are now shared across modules if more than one Cython
  implemented module is imported.

* The type inference algorithm works more fine granular by taking the
  results of the control flow analysis into account.

* A new script in ``bin/cythonize`` provides a command line frontend
  to the cythonize() compilation function (including distutils build).

* The new extension type decorator ``@cython.no_gc_clear`` prevents
  objects from being cleared during cyclic garbage collection, thus
  making sure that object attributes are kept alive until deallocation.

* During cyclic garbage collection, attributes of extension types that
  cannot create reference cycles due to their type (e.g. strings) are
  no longer considered for traversal or clearing.  This can reduce the
  processing overhead when searching for or cleaning up reference cycles.

* Package compilation (i.e. ``__init__.py`` files) now works, starting
  with Python 3.3.

* The cython-mode.el script for Emacs was updated.  Patch by Ivan Andrus.

* An option common_utility_include_dir was added to cythonize() to save
  oft-used utility code once in a separate directory rather than as
  part of each generated file.

* ``unraisable_tracebacks`` directive added to control printing of
  tracebacks of unraisable exceptions.

Bugs fixed
----------

* Abstract Python classes that subtyped a Cython extension type
  failed to raise an exception on instantiation, and thus ended
  up being instantiated.

* ``set.add(a_tuple)`` and ``set.discard(a_tuple)`` failed with a
  TypeError in Py2.4.

* The PEP 3155 ``__qualname__`` was incorrect for nested classes and
  inner classes/functions declared as ``global``.

* Several corner cases in the try-finally statement were fixed.

* The metaclass of a Python class was not inherited from its parent
  class(es).  It is now extracted from the list of base classes if not
  provided explicitly using the Py3 ``metaclass`` keyword argument.
  In Py2 compilation mode, a ``__metaclass__`` entry in the class
  dict will still take precedence if not using Py3 metaclass syntax,
  but only *after* creating the class dict (which may have been done
  by a metaclass of a base class, see PEP 3115).  It is generally
  recommended to use the explicit Py3 syntax to define metaclasses
  for Python types at compile time.

* The automatic C switch statement generation behaves more safely for
  heterogeneous value types (e.g. mixing enum and char), allowing for
  a slightly wider application and reducing corner cases.  It now always
  generates a 'default' clause to avoid C compiler warnings about
  unmatched enum values.

* Fixed a bug where class hierarchies declared out-of-order could result
  in broken generated code.

* Fixed a bug which prevented overriding const methods of C++ classes.

* Fixed a crash when converting Python objects to C++ strings fails.

Other changes
-------------

* In Py3 compilation mode, Python2-style metaclasses declared by a
  ``__metaclass__`` class dict entry are ignored.

* In Py3.4+, the Cython generator type uses ``tp_finalize()`` for safer
  cleanup instead of ``tp_del()``.


0.19.2 (2013-10-13)
===================

Features added
--------------

Bugs fixed
----------

* Some standard declarations were fixed or updated, including the previously
  incorrect declaration of ``PyBuffer_FillInfo()`` and some missing bits in
  ``libc.math``.

* Heap allocated subtypes of ``type`` used the wrong base type struct at the
  C level.

* Calling the unbound method dict.keys/value/items() in dict subtypes could
  call the bound object method instead of the unbound supertype method.

* "yield" wasn't supported in "return" value expressions.

* Using the "bint" type in memory views lead to unexpected results.
  It is now an error.

* Assignments to global/closure variables could catch them in an illegal state
  while deallocating the old value.

Other changes
-------------


0.19.1 (2013-05-11)
===================

Features added
--------------

* Completely empty C-API structs for extension type slots (protocols like
  number/mapping/sequence) are no longer generated into the C code.

* Docstrings that directly follow a public/readonly attribute declaration
  in a cdef class will be used as docstring of the auto-generated property.
  This fixes ticket 206.

* The automatic signature documentation tries to preserve more semantics
  of default arguments and argument types.  Specifically, ``bint`` arguments
  now appear as type ``bool``.

* A warning is emitted when negative literal indices are found inside of
  a code section that disables ``wraparound`` handling.  This helps with
  fixing invalid code that might fail in the face of future compiler
  optimisations.

* Constant folding for boolean expressions (and/or) was improved.

* Added a build_dir option to cythonize() which allows one to place
  the generated .c files outside the source tree.

Bugs fixed
----------

* ``isinstance(X, type)`` failed to get optimised into a call to
  ``PyType_Check()``, as done for other builtin types.

* A spurious ``from datetime cimport *`` was removed from the "cpython"
  declaration package. This means that the "datetime" declarations
  (added in 0.19) are no longer available directly from the "cpython"
  namespace, but only from "cpython.datetime". This is the correct
  way of doing it because the declarations refer to a standard library
  module, not the core CPython C-API itself.

* The C code for extension types is now generated in topological order
  instead of source code order to avoid C compiler errors about missing
  declarations for subtypes that are defined before their parent.

* The ``memoryview`` type name no longer shows up in the module dict of
  modules that use memory views.  This fixes trac ticket 775.

* Regression in 0.19 that rejected valid C expressions from being used
  in C array size declarations.

* In C++ mode, the C99-only keyword ``restrict`` could accidentally be
  seen by the GNU C++ compiler. It is now specially handled for both
  GCC and MSVC.

* Testing large (> int) C integer values for their truth value could fail
  due to integer wrap-around.

Other changes
-------------


0.19 (2013-04-19)
=================

Features added
--------------

* New directives ``c_string_type`` and ``c_string_encoding`` to more easily
  and automatically convert between C strings and the different Python string
  types.

* The extension type flag ``Py_TPFLAGS_HAVE_VERSION_TAG`` is enabled by default
  on extension types and can be disabled using the ``type_version_tag`` compiler
  directive.

* EXPERIMENTAL support for simple Cython code level line tracing.  Enabled by
  the "linetrace" compiler directive.

* Cython implemented functions make their argument and return type annotations
  available through the ``__annotations__`` attribute (PEP 3107).

* Access to non-cdef module globals and Python object attributes is faster.

* ``Py_UNICODE*`` coerces from and to Python unicode strings.  This is
  helpful when talking to Windows APIs, which use compatible wchar_t
  arrays for strings.  Note that the ``Py_UNICODE`` type is otherwise
  deprecated as of CPython 3.3.

* ``isinstance(obj, basestring)`` is optimised.  In Python 3 it only tests
  for instances of ``str`` (i.e. Py2 ``unicode``).

* The ``basestring`` builtin is mapped to ``str`` (i.e. Py2 ``unicode``) when
  compiling the generated C code under Python 3.

* Closures use freelists, which can speed up their creation quite substantially.
  This is also visible for short running generator expressions, for example.

* A new class decorator ``@cython.freelist(N)`` creates a static freelist of N
  instances for an extension type, thus avoiding the costly allocation step if
  possible. This can speed up object instantiation by 20-30% in suitable
  scenarios. Note that freelists are currently only supported for base types,
  not for types that inherit from others.

* Fast extension type instantiation using the ``Type.__new__(Type)`` idiom has
  gained support for passing arguments.  It is also a bit faster for types defined
  inside of the module.

* The Python2-only dict methods ``.iter*()`` and ``.view*()`` (requires Python 2.7)
  are automatically mapped to the equivalent keys/values/items methods in Python 3
  for typed dictionaries.

* Slicing unicode strings, lists and tuples is faster.

* list.append() is faster on average.

* ``raise Exception() from None`` suppresses the exception context in Py3.3.

* Py3 compatible ``exec(tuple)`` syntax is supported in Py2 code.

* Keyword arguments are supported for cdef functions.

* External C++ classes can be declared nogil.  Patch by John Stumpo.  This fixes
  trac ticket 805.

Bugs fixed
----------

* 2-value slicing of unknown objects passes the correct slice when the ``getitem``
  protocol is used instead of the ``getslice`` protocol (especially in Python 3),
  i.e. ``None`` values for missing bounds instead of ``[0,maxsize]``.  It is also
  a bit faster in some cases, e.g. for constant bounds.  This fixes trac ticket 636.

* Cascaded assignments of None values to extension type variables failed with
  a ``TypeError`` at runtime.

* The ``__defaults__`` attribute was not writable for Cython implemented
  functions.

* Default values of keyword-only arguments showed up in ``__defaults__`` instead
  of ``__kwdefaults__`` (which was not implemented).  Both are available for
  Cython implemented functions now, as specified in Python 3.x.

* ``yield`` works inside of ``with gil`` sections.  It previously lead to a crash.
  This fixes trac ticket 803.

* Static methods without explicitly named positional arguments (e.g. having only
  ``*args``) crashed when being called.  This fixes trac ticket 804.

* ``dir()`` without arguments previously returned an unsorted list, which now
  gets sorted as expected.

* ``dict.items()``, ``dict.keys()`` and ``dict.values()`` no longer return lists
  in Python 3.

* Exiting from an ``except-as`` clause now deletes the exception in Python 3 mode.

* The declarations of ``frexp()`` and ``ldexp()`` in ``math.pxd`` were incorrect.

Other changes
-------------


0.18 (2013-01-28)
=================

Features added
--------------

* Named Unicode escapes ("\N{...}") are supported.

* Python functions/classes provide the special attribute "__qualname__"
  as defined by PEP 3155.

* Added a directive ``overflowcheck`` which raises an OverflowException when
  arithmetic with C ints overflow.  This has a modest performance penalty, but
  is much faster than using Python ints.

* Calls to nested Python functions are resolved at compile time.

* Type inference works across nested functions.

* ``py_bytes_string.decode(...)`` is optimised.

* C ``const`` declarations are supported in the language.

Bugs fixed
----------

* Automatic C++ exception mapping didn't work in nogil functions (only in
  "with nogil" blocks).

Other changes
-------------


0.17.4 (2013-01-03)
===================

Bugs fixed
----------

* Garbage collection triggered during deallocation of container classes could lead to a double-deallocation.


0.17.3 (2012-12-14)
===================

Features added
--------------

Bugs fixed
----------

* During final interpreter cleanup (with types cleanup enabled at compile time), extension types that inherit from base types over more than one level that were cimported from other modules could lead to a crash.

* Weak-reference support in extension types (with a ``cdef __weakref__`` attribute) generated incorrect deallocation code.

* In CPython 3.3, converting a Unicode character to the Py_UNICODE type could fail to raise an overflow for non-BMP characters that do not fit into a wchar_t on the current platform.

* Negative C integer constants lost their longness suffix in the generated C code.

Other changes
-------------


0.17.2 (2012-11-20)
===================

Features added
--------------

* ``cythonize()`` gained a best effort compile mode that can be used to simply ignore .py files that fail to compile.

Bugs fixed
----------

* Replacing an object reference with the value of one of its cdef attributes could generate incorrect C code that accessed the object after deleting its last reference.

* C-to-Python type coercions during cascaded comparisons could generate invalid C code, specifically when using the 'in' operator.

* "obj[1,]" passed a single integer into the item getter instead of a tuple.

* Cyclic imports at module init time did not work in Py3.

* The names of C++ destructors for template classes were built incorrectly.

* In pure mode, type casts in Cython syntax and the C ampersand operator are now rejected. Use the pure mode replacements instead.

* In pure mode, C type names and the sizeof() function are no longer recognised as such and can be used as normal Python names.

* The extended C level support for the CPython array type was declared too late to be used by user defined classes.

* C++ class nesting was broken.

* Better checking for required nullary constructors for stack-allocated C++ instances.

* Remove module docstring in no-docstring mode.

* Fix specialization for varargs function signatures.

* Fix several compiler crashes.

Other changes
-------------

* An experimental distutils script for compiling the CPython standard library was added as Tools/cystdlib.py.


0.17.1 (2012-09-26)
===================

Features added
--------------

Bugs fixed
----------

* A reference leak was fixed in the new dict iteration code when the loop target was not a plain variable but an unpacked tuple.

* Memory views did not handle the special case of a NULL buffer strides value, as allowed by PEP3118.

Other changes
-------------


0.17 (2012-09-01)
=================

Features added
--------------

* Alpha quality support for compiling and running Cython generated extension modules in PyPy (through cpyext). Note that this requires at least PyPy 1.9 and in many cases also adaptations in user code, especially to avoid borrowed references when no owned reference is being held directly in C space (a reference in a Python list or dict is not enough, for example). See the documentation on porting Cython code to PyPy.

* "yield from" is supported (PEP 380) and a couple of minor problems with generators were fixed.

* C++ STL container classes automatically coerce from and to the equivalent Python container types on typed assignments and casts. Note that the data in the containers is copied during this conversion.

* C++ iterators can now be iterated over using "for x in cpp_container" whenever cpp_container has begin() and end() methods returning objects satisfying the iterator pattern (that is, it can be incremented, dereferenced, and compared (for non-equality)).

* cdef classes can now have C++ class members (provided a zero-argument constructor exists)

* A new cpython.array standard cimport file allows to efficiently talk to the stdlib array.array data type in Python 2. Since CPython does not export an official C-API for this module, it receives special casing by the compiler in order to avoid setup overhead on user side. In Python 3, both buffers and memory views on the array type already worked out of the box with earlier versions of Cython due to the native support for the buffer interface in the Py3 array module.

* Fast dict iteration is now enabled optimistically also for untyped variables when the common iteration methods are used.

* The unicode string processing code was adapted for the upcoming CPython 3.3 (PEP 393, new Unicode buffer layout).

* Buffer arguments and memory view arguments in Python functions can be declared "not None" to raise a TypeError on None input.

* c(p)def functions in pure mode can specify their return type with "@cython.returns()".

* Automatic dispatch for fused functions with memoryview arguments

* Support newaxis indexing for memoryviews

* Support decorators for fused functions

Bugs fixed
----------

* Old-style Py2 imports did not work reliably in Python 3.x and were broken in Python 3.3. Regardless of this fix, it's generally best to be explicit about relative and global imports in Cython code because old-style imports have a higher overhead. To this end, "from __future__ import absolute_import" is supported in Python/Cython 2.x code now (previous versions of Cython already used it when compiling Python 3 code).

* Stricter constraints on the "inline" and "final" modifiers. If your code does not compile due to this change, chances are these modifiers were previously being ignored by the compiler and can be removed without any performance regression.

* Exceptions are always instantiated while raising them (as in Python), instead of risking to instantiate them in potentially unsafe situations when they need to be handled or otherwise processed.

* locals() properly ignores names that do not have Python compatible types (including automatically inferred types).

* Some garbage collection issues of memory views were fixed.

* numpy.pxd compiles in Python 3 mode.

* Several C compiler warnings were fixed.

* Several bugs related to memoryviews and fused types were fixed.

* Several bug-fixes and improvements related to cythonize(), including ccache-style caching.

Other changes
-------------

* libc.string provides a convenience declaration for const uchar in addition to const char.

* User declared char* types are now recognised as such and auto-coerce to and from Python bytes strings.

* callable() and next() compile to more efficient C code.

* list.append() is faster on average.

* Modules generated by @cython.inline() are written into the directory pointed to by the environment variable CYTHON_CACHE_DIR if set.


0.16 (2012-04-21)
=================

Features added
--------------

* Enhancements to Cython's function type (support for weak references, default arguments, code objects, dynamic attributes, classmethods, staticmethods, and more)

* Fused Types - Template-like support for functions and methods CEP 522 (docs)

* Typed views on memory - Support for efficient direct and indirect buffers (indexing, slicing, transposing, ...) CEP 517 (docs)

* super() without arguments

* Final cdef methods (which translate into direct calls on known instances)

Bugs fixed
----------

* fix alignment handling for record types in buffer support

Other changes
-------------

* support default arguments for closures

* search sys.path for pxd files

* support C++ template casting

* faster traceback building and faster generator termination

* support inplace operators on indexed buffers

* allow nested prange sections


0.15.1 (2011-09-19)
===================

Features added
--------------

Bugs fixed
----------

Other changes
-------------


0.15 (2011-08-05)
=================

Features added
--------------

* Generators (yield) - Cython has full support for generators, generator expressions and PEP 342 coroutines.

* The nonlocal keyword is supported.

* Re-acquiring the gil: with gil - works as expected within a nogil context.

* OpenMP support: prange.

* Control flow analysis prunes dead code and emits warnings and errors about uninitialised variables.

* Debugger command cy set to assign values of expressions to Cython variables and cy exec counterpart $cy_eval().

* Exception chaining PEP 3134.

* Relative imports PEP 328.

* Improved pure syntax including cython.cclass, cython.cfunc, and cython.ccall.

* The with statement has its own dedicated and faster C implementation.

* Support for del.

* Boundschecking directives implemented for builtin Python sequence types.

* Several updates and additions to the shipped standard library .pxd files.

* Forward declaration of types is no longer required for circular references.

Bugs fixed
----------

Other changes
-------------

* Uninitialized variables are no longer initialized to None and accessing them has the same semantics as standard Python.

* globals() now returns a read-only dict of the Cython module's globals, rather than the globals of the first non-Cython module in the stack

* Many C++ exceptions are now special cased to give closer Python counterparts. This means that except+ functions that formerly raised generic RuntimeErrors may raise something else such as ArithmeticError.

* The inlined generator expressions (introduced in Cython 0.13) were disabled in favour of full generator expression support. This breaks code that previously used them inside of cdef functions (usage in def functions continues to work) and induces a performance regression for cases that continue to work but that were previously inlined. We hope to reinstate this feature in the near future.


0.14.1 (2011-02-04)
===================

Features added
--------------

* The gdb debugging support was extended to include all major Cython features, including closures.

* raise MemoryError() is now safe to use as Cython replaces it with the correct C-API call.

Bugs fixed
----------

Other changes
-------------

* Decorators on special methods of cdef classes now raise a compile time error rather than being ignored.

* In Python 3 language level mode (-3 option), the 'str' type is now mapped to 'unicode', so that cdef str s declares a Unicode string even when running in Python 2.


0.14 (2010-12-14)
=================

Features added
--------------

* Python classes can now be nested and receive a proper closure at definition time.

* Redefinition is supported for Python functions, even within the same scope.

* Lambda expressions are supported in class bodies and at the module level.

* Metaclasses are supported for Python classes, both in Python 2 and Python 3 syntax. The Python 3 syntax (using a keyword argument in the type declaration) is preferred and optimised at compile time.

* "final" extension classes prevent inheritance in Python space. This feature is available through the new "cython.final" decorator. In the future, these classes may receive further optimisations.

* "internal" extension classes do not show up in the module dictionary. This feature is available through the new "cython.internal" decorator.

* Extension type inheritance from builtin types, such as "cdef class MyUnicode(unicode)", now works without further external type redeclarations (which are also strongly discouraged now and continue to issue a warning).

* GDB support. https://docs.cython.org/src/userguide/debugging.html

* A new build system with support for inline distutils directives, correct dependency tracking, and parallel compilation. https://github.com/cython/cython/wiki/enhancements-distutils_preprocessing

* Support for dynamic compilation at runtime via the new cython.inline function and cython.compile decorator. https://github.com/cython/cython/wiki/enhancements-inline

* "nogil" blocks are supported when compiling pure Python code by writing "with cython.nogil".

* Iterating over arbitrary pointer types is now supported, as is an optimized version of the in operator, e.g. x in ptr[a:b].

Bugs fixed
----------

* In parallel assignments, the right side was evaluated in reverse order in 0.13. This could result in errors if it had side effects (e.g. function calls).

* In some cases, methods of builtin types would raise a SystemError instead of an AttributeError when called on None.

Other changes
-------------

* Constant tuples are now cached over the lifetime of an extension module, just like CPython does. Constant argument tuples of Python function calls are also cached.

* Closures have tightened to include exactly the names used in the inner functions and classes. Previously, they held the complete locals of the defining function.

* The builtin "next()" function in Python 2.6 and later is now implemented internally and therefore available in all Python versions. This makes it the preferred and portable way of manually advancing an iterator.

* In addition to the previously supported inlined generator expressions in 0.13, "sorted(genexpr)" can now be used as well. Typing issues were fixed in "sum(genexpr)" that could lead to invalid C code being generated. Other known issues with inlined generator expressions were also fixed that make upgrading to 0.14 a strong recommendation for code that uses them. Note that general generators and generator expressions continue to be not supported.

* Inplace arithmetic operators now respect the cdivision directive and are supported for complex types.

* Typing a variable as type "complex" previously gave it the Python object type. It now uses the appropriate C/C++ double complex type. A side-effect is that assignments and typed function parameters now accept anything that Python can coerce to a complex, including integers and floats, and not only complex instances.

* Large integer literals pass through the compiler in a safer way. To prevent truncation in C code, non 32-bit literals are turned into Python objects if not used in a C context. This context can either be given by a clear C literal suffix such as "UL" or "LL" (or "L" in Python 3 code), or it can be an assignment to a typed variable or a typed function argument, in which case it is up to the user to take care of a sufficiently large value space of the target.

* Python functions are declared in the order they appear in the file, rather than all being created at module creation time. This is consistent with Python and needed to support, for example, conditional or repeated declarations of functions. In the face of circular imports this may cause code to break, so a new --disable-function-redefinition flag was added to revert to the old behavior. This flag will be removed in a future release, so should only be used as a stopgap until old code can be fixed.


0.13 (2010-08-25)
=================

Features added
--------------

* Closures are fully supported for Python functions. Cython supports inner functions and lambda expressions. Generators and generator expressions are not supported in this release.

* Proper C++ support. Cython knows about C++ classes, templates and overloaded function signatures, so that Cython code can interact with them in a straight forward way.

* Type inference is enabled by default for safe C types (e.g. double, bint, C++ classes) and known extension types. This reduces the need for explicit type declarations and can improve the performance of untyped code in some cases. There is also a verbose compile mode for testing the impact on user code.

* Cython's for-in-loop can iterate over C arrays and sliced pointers. The type of the loop variable will be inferred automatically in this case.

* The Py_UNICODE integer type for Unicode code points is fully supported, including for-loops and 'in' tests on unicode strings. It coerces from and to single character unicode strings. Note that untyped for-loop variables will automatically be inferred as Py_UNICODE when iterating over a unicode string. In most cases, this will be much more efficient than yielding sliced string objects, but can also have a negative performance impact when the variable is used in a Python context multiple times, so that it needs to coerce to a unicode string object more than once. If this happens, typing the loop variable as unicode or object will help.

* The built-in functions any(), all(), sum(), list(), set() and dict() are inlined as plain for loops when called on generator expressions. Note that generator expressions are not generally supported apart from this feature. Also, tuple(genexpr) is not currently supported - use tuple([listcomp]) instead.

* More shipped standard library declarations. The python_* and stdlib/stdio .pxd files have been deprecated in favor of clib.* and cpython[.*] and may get removed in a future release.

* Pure Python mode no longer disallows non-Python keywords like 'cdef', 'include' or 'cimport'. It also no longer recognises syntax extensions like the for-from loop.

* Parsing has improved for Python 3 syntax in Python code, although not all features are correctly supported. The missing Python 3 features are being worked on for the next release.

* from __future__ import print_function is supported in Python 2.6 and later. Note that there is currently no emulation for earlier Python versions, so code that uses print() with this future import will require at least Python 2.6.

* New compiler directive language_level (valid values: 2 or 3) with corresponding command line options -2 and -3 requests source code compatibility with Python 2.x or Python 3.x respectively. Language level 3 currently enforces unicode literals for unprefixed string literals, enables the print function (requires Python 2.6 or later) and keeps loop variables in list comprehensions from leaking.

* Loop variables in set/dict comprehensions no longer leak into the surrounding scope (following Python 2.7). List comprehensions are unchanged in language level 2.

* print >> stream

Bugs fixed
----------

Other changes
-------------

* The availability of type inference by default means that Cython will also infer the type of pointers on assignments. Previously, code like this::

     cdef char* s = ...
     untyped_variable = s

  would convert the char* to a Python bytes string and assign that. This is no longer the case and no coercion will happen in the example above. The correct way of doing this is through an explicit cast or by typing the target variable, i.e.

  ::

     cdef char* s = ...
     untyped_variable1 = <bytes>s
     untyped_variable2 = <object>s

     cdef object py_object = s
     cdef bytes  bytes_string = s

* bool is no longer a valid type name by default. The problem is that it's not clear whether bool should refer to the Python type or the C++ type, and expecting one and finding the other has already led to several hard-to-find bugs. Both types are available for importing: you can use from cpython cimport bool for the Python bool type, and from libcpp cimport bool for the C++ type. bool is still a valid object by default, so one can still write bool(x).

* ``__getsegcount__`` is now correctly typed to take a ``Py_size_t*`` rather than an ``int*``.


0.12.1 (2010-02-02)
===================

Features added
--------------

* Type inference improvements.

  * There have been several bug fixes and improvements to the type inferencer.

  * Notably, there is now a "safe" mode enabled by setting the infer_types directive to None. (The None here refers to the "default" mode, which will be the default in 0.13.) This safe mode limits inference to Python object types and C doubles, which should speed up execution without affecting any semantics such as integer overflow behavior like infer_types=True might. There is also an infer_types.verbose option which allows one to see what types are inferred.

* The boundscheck directive works for lists and tuples as well as buffers.

* len(s) and s.decode("encoding") are efficiently supported for char* s.

* Cython's INLINE macro has been renamed to CYTHON_INLINE to reduce conflict and has better support for the MSVC compiler on Windows. It is no longer clobbered if externally defined.

* Revision history is now omitted from the source package, resulting in a 85% size reduction. Running make repo will download the history and turn the directory into a complete Mercurial working repository.

* Cython modules don't need to be recompiled when the size of an external type grows. (A warning, rather than an error, is produced.) This should be helpful for binary distributions relying on NumPy.

Bugs fixed
----------

* Several other bugs and minor improvements have been made. This release should be fully backwards compatible with 0.12.

Other changes
-------------


0.12 (2009-11-23)
=================

Features added
--------------

* Type inference with the infer_types directive

* Seamless C++ complex support

* Fast extension type instantiation using the normal Python meme obj = MyType.__new__(MyType)

* Improved support for Py3.1

* Cython now runs under Python 3.x using the 2to3 tool

* unittest support for doctests in Cython modules

* Optimised handling of C strings (char*): for c in cstring[2:50] and cstring.decode()

* Looping over c pointers: for i in intptr[:50].

* pyximport improvements

* cython_freeze improvements

Bugs fixed
----------

* Many bug fixes

Other changes
-------------

* Many other optimisation, e.g. enumerate() loops, parallel swap assignments (a,b = b,a), and unicode.encode()

* More complete numpy.pxd


0.11.2 (2009-05-20)
===================

Features added

* There's now native complex floating point support! C99 complex will be used if complex.h is included, otherwise explicit complex arithmetic working on all C compilers is used. [Robert Bradshaw]

  ::

      cdef double complex a = 1 + 0.3j
      cdef np.ndarray[np.complex128_t, ndim=2] arr = \
         np.zeros(10, np.complex128)

* Cython can now generate a main()-method for embedding of the Python interpreter into an executable (see #289) [Robert Bradshaw]

* @wraparound directive (another way to disable arr[idx] for negative idx) [Dag Sverre Seljebotn]

* Correct support for NumPy record dtypes with different alignments, and "cdef packed struct" support [Dag Sverre Seljebotn]

* @callspec directive, allowing custom calling convention macros [Lisandro Dalcin]
