        **PLEASE READ THIS FIRST:**
        - DO NOT use the bug and feature tracker for general questions and support requests.
        Use the [`cython-users`](https://groups.google.com/g/cython-users) mailing list instead.
        It has a wider audience, so you get more and better answers.
        - Did you search for SIMILAR ISSUES already?
        Please do, it helps to save us precious time that we otherwise could not invest into development.
        - Did you try the LATEST MASTER BRANCH or pre-release?
        It might already have what you want to report.
        Specifically, the legacy stable 0.29.x release series receives only important low-risk bug fixes.
        Also see the [Changelog](https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/master/CHANGES.rst) regarding recent changes
