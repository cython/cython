<!--
**Note:**
- DO NOT use the bug and feature tracker for general questions and support requests.
  Use the `cython-users` mailing list instead.
  It has a wider audience, so you get more and better answers.
- Did you search for similar issues already?
  Please do, it helps to save us precious time that we otherwise could not invest into development.
- Did you try the latest master branch or pre-release?
  It might already have what you want to report.
  Also see the [Changelog](https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/master/CHANGES.rst) regarding recent changes.
