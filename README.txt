Welcome to Cython!
=================

Cython (http://www.cython.org) is based on Pyrex, but supports more
cutting edge functionality and optimizations.

LICENSE:

The original Pyrex program was licensed "free of restrictions" (see
below).  Cython itself is licensed under the 

   PYTHON SOFTWARE FOUNDATION LICENSE
   http://www.python.org/psf/license/



--------------------------

There are TWO mercurial (hg) repositories included with Cython:

   * Various project files, documentation, etc. (in the top level directory)
   * The main codebase itself (in Cython/)
   
We keep these separate for easier merging with the Pyrex project. 

To see the change history for Cython code itself, go to the Cython
directory and type 

 $ hg log

This requires that you have installed Mercurial.
