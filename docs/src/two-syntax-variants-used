This page uses two different syntax variants: the Cython specific ``cdef`` syntax
and static Cython type declarations in
:ref:`pure Python code <pep484_type_annotations>`,
following `PEP-484 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/>`_ type hints
and `PEP 526 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0526/>`_ variable annotations.
To make good use of the latter, including C data types etc., you need
the special ``cython`` module, which you can import with

.. code-block:: python

    import cython

in the Python module that you want to compile.
