Fused Types (Templates)
**************************

Fused types can be used to fuse multiple types into a single type, to allow a single
algorithm to operate on values of multiple types. They are somewhat akin to templates
or generics.

.. Note:: Support is experimental and new in this release, there may be bugs!

Declaring Fused Types
=====================

Fused types may be declared as follows::

    cimport cython

    ctypedef fused my_fused_type:
        cython.p_int
        cython.p_float

This declares a new type called ``my_fused_type`` which is composed of a ``int *`` and a ``double *``.
Alternatively, the declaration may be written as::

    my_fused_type = cython.fused_type(cython.p_int, cython.p_float)

Only names may be used for the constituent types, but they may be any (non-fused) type, including a typedef.
i.e. one may write::

    ctypedef double *doublep
    my_fused_type = cython.fused_type(cython.p_int, doublep)

Using Fused Types
=================
Fused types can be used to declare parameters of functions or methods::

    cdef cfunc(my_fused_type arg1, my_fused_type arg2):
        return cython.typeof(arg1) == cython.typeof(arg2)

This declares a function with two parameters. The type of both parameters is either a pointer to an int,
or a pointer to a float (according to the previous examples). So this function always True for every possible
invocation. You are allowed to mix fused types however::

    def func(A x, B y):
        ...

where ``A`` and ``B`` are different fused types. This will result in all combination of types.

Note that specializations of only numeric types may not be very useful, as one can usually rely on
promotion of types. This is not true for arrays, pointers and typed views of memory however.
Indeed, one may write::

    def myfunc(A[:, :] x):
        ...

    # and

    cdef otherfunc(A *x):
        ...


Selecting Specializations
=========================
You can select a specialization (an instance of the function with specific or specialized (i.e.,
non-fused) argument types) in two ways: either by indexing or by calling.

Indexing
--------
You can index functions with types to get certain specializations, i.e.::

    cfunc[cython.p_double](p1, p2)

    # From Cython space
    func[float, double](myfloat, mydouble)

    # From Python space
    func[cython.float, cython.double](myfloat, mydouble)

If a fused type is used as a base type, this will mean that the base type is the fused type, so the
base type is what needs to be specialized::

    cdef myfunc(A *x):
        ...

    # Specialize using int, not int *
    myfunc[int](myint)

Calling
-------
A fused function can also be called with arguments, where the dispatch is figured out automatically::

    cfunc(p1, p2)
    func(myfloat, mydouble)

For a ``cdef`` or ``cpdef`` function called from Cython this means that the specialization is figured
out at compile time. For ``def`` functions the arguments are typechecked at runtime, and a best-effort
approach is performed to figure out which specialization is needed. This means that this may result in
a runtime ``TypeError`` if no specialization was found. A ``cpdef`` function is treated the same way as
a ``def`` function if the type of the function is unknown (e.g. if it is external and there is no cimport
for it).

The automatic dispatching rules are typically as follows, in order of preference:
    * try to find an exact match
    * choose the biggest corresponding numerical type (biggest float, biggest complex, biggest int)

Built-in Fused Types
====================
There are some built-in fused types available for convenience, these are::

    cython.integral # int, long
    cython.floating # float, double
    cython.numeric  # long, double, double complex

Casting Fused Functions
=======================
Fused ``cdef`` and ``cpdef`` functions may be cast or assigned to C function pointers as follows::

    cdef myfunc(cython.floating, cython.integral):
        ...

    # assign directly
    cdef object (*funcp)(float, int)
    funcp = myfunc
    funcp(f, i)

    # alternatively, cast it
    (<object (*)(float, int)> myfunc)(f, i)

    # This is also valid
    funcp = myfunc[float, int]
    funcp(f, i)

Type Checking Specializations
=============================
Decisions can be made based on the specializations of the fused parameters. False conditions are pruned
to avoid invalid code. One may check with ``is``, ``is not`` and ``==`` and ``!=`` to see if a fused type
is equal to a certain other non-fused type (to check the specialization), or use ``in`` and ``not in`` to
figure out whether a specialization is part of another set of types (specified as a fused type). In
example::

    ctypedef fused bunch_of_types:
        ...

    ctypedef fused string_t:
        cython.p_char
        bytes
        unicode

    cdef cython.integral myfunc(cython.integral i, bunch_of_types s):
        cdef int *int_pointer
        cdef long *long_pointer

        # Only one of these branches will be compiled for each specialization!
        if cython.integral is int:
            int_pointer = &i
        else:
            long_pointer = &i

        if bunch_of_types in string_t:
            print "s is a string!"

__signatures__
==============
Finally, function objects from ``def`` or ``cpdef`` functions have an attribute __signatures__, which maps
the signature strings to the actual specialized functions. This may be useful for inspection.
Listed signature strings may also be used as indices to the fused function::

    specialized_function = fused_function["MyExtensionClass, int, float"]

It would usually be preferred to index like this, however::

    specialized_function = fused_function[MyExtensionClass, int, float]

Although the latter will select the biggest types for ``int`` and ``float`` from Python space, as they are
not type identifiers but builtin types there. Passing ``cython.int`` and ``cython.float`` would resolve that,
however.
