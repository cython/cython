Implementing the buffer protocol
================================

Cython objects can expose memory buffers to Python code
by implementing the "buffer protocol".
This chapter shows how to implement the protocol
and make use of the memory managed by an extension type from NumPy.


A matrix class
--------------

The following Cython/C++ code implements a matrix of floats,
where the number of columns is fixed at construction time
but rows can be added dynamically.

.. tabs::

    .. group-tab:: Pure Python

        .. literalinclude:: ../../examples/userguide/buffer/matrix.py

    .. group-tab:: Cython

        .. literalinclude:: ../../examples/userguide/buffer/matrix.pyx

There are no methods to do anything productive with the matrices' contents.
We could implement custom ``__getitem__``, ``__setitem__``, etc. for this,
but instead we'll use the buffer protocol to expose the matrix's data to Python
so we can use NumPy to do useful work.

Implementing the buffer protocol requires adding two methods,
``__getbuffer__`` and ``__releasebuffer__``,
which Cython handles specially.

.. tabs::

    .. group-tab:: Pure Python

        .. literalinclude:: ../../examples/userguide/buffer/matrix_with_buffer.py

    .. group-tab:: Cython

        .. literalinclude:: ../../examples/userguide/buffer/matrix_with_buffer.pyx

The method ``Matrix.__getbuffer__`` fills a descriptor structure,
called a ``Py_buffer``, that is defined by the Python C-API.
It contains a pointer to the actual buffer in memory,
as well as metadata about the shape of the array and the strides
(step sizes to get from one element or row to the next).
Its ``shape`` and ``strides`` members are pointers
that must point to arrays of type and size ``Py_ssize_t[ndim]``.
These arrays have to stay alive as long as any buffer views the data,
so we store them on the ``Matrix`` object as members.

The code is not yet complete, but we can already compile it
and test the basic functionality.

::

    >>> from matrix import Matrix
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> m = Matrix(10)
    >>> np.asarray(m)
    array([], shape=(0, 10), dtype=float32)
    >>> m.add_row()
    >>> a = np.asarray(m)
    >>> a[:] = 1
    >>> m.add_row()
    >>> a = np.asarray(m)
    >>> a
    array([[ 1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.],
           [ 0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.]], dtype=float32)

Now we can view the ``Matrix`` as a NumPy ``ndarray``,
and modify its contents using standard NumPy operations.


Memory safety and reference counting
------------------------------------

The ``Matrix`` class as implemented so far is unsafe.
The ``add_row`` operation can move the underlying buffer,
which invalidates any NumPy (or other) view on the data.
If you try to access values after an ``add_row`` call,
you'll get outdated values or a segfault.

This is where ``__releasebuffer__`` comes in.
We can add a reference count to each matrix,
and lock it for mutation whenever a view exists.

.. tabs::

    .. group-tab:: Pure Python

        .. literalinclude:: ../../examples/userguide/buffer/view_count.py

    .. group-tab:: Cython

        .. literalinclude:: ../../examples/userguide/buffer/view_count.pyx

Flags
-----
We skipped some input validation in the code.
The ``flags`` argument to ``__getbuffer__`` comes from ``np.asarray``
(and other clients) and is an OR of boolean flags
that describe the kind of array that is requested.
Strictly speaking, if the flags contain ``PyBUF_ND``, ``PyBUF_SIMPLE``,
or ``PyBUF_F_CONTIGUOUS``, ``__getbuffer__`` must raise a ``BufferError``.
These macros can be ``cimport``'d from ``cpython.buffer``.

(The matrix-in-vector structure actually conforms to ``PyBUF_ND``,
but that would prohibit ``__getbuffer__`` from filling in the strides.
A single-row matrix is F-contiguous, but a larger matrix is not.)

A tutorial for using this API from C is on Jake Vanderplas's blog,

`Python 3 <https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/buffer.html>`_
and `Python 2 <https://docs.python.org/2.7/c-api/buffer.html>`_.
The Py2 documentation also describes an older buffer protocol
that is no longer in use;
since Python 2.6, the :PEP:`3118` protocol has been implemented,
and the older protocol is only relevant for legacy code.
