üå∑Ô∏è Thank you for your interest in supporting Cython! üå∑Ô∏è
=========================================================

Managing, maintaining and advancing a project as large as Cython takes
**a lot of time and dedication**.  This is really a full-time job that
is currently done by **Stefan Behnel**, paid by users just like you.

**Your support can make a difference**
for improving a great tool that helps you every day!
