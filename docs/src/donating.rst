üå∑Ô∏è Thank you for your interest in supporting Cython! üå∑Ô∏è
=========================================================

Managing, maintaining and advancing a project as large as Cython takes
**a lot of time and dedication**.

**Your support can make a difference**
for a great tool that helps you every day!

Please consider signing a subscription for continuous project support via

* `GitHub Sponsors <https://github.com/users/scoder/sponsorship>`_
* `Tidelift <https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/pypi-cython>`_
* `PayPal <https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=HLS9JEYD4ETB6&source=url>`_

or donating via

* `PayPal <https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=HLS9JEYD4ETB6&source=url>`_

Note that PayPal takes 5 - 15% fees for small non-EUR payments,
which is money that *you pay without helping us*.
Consider signing up for a GitHub Sponsors subscription instead,
which is currently free of additional charges.

Also note that we are not accepting donations in crypto currencies.
Much of the development for Cython is done in a carbon-neutral way
or with compensated and very low emissions.
Crypto currencies do not fit into this ambition.
