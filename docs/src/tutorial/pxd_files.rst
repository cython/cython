pxd files
=========

In addition to the ``.pyx`` source files, Cython uses ``.pxd`` files
which work like C header files -- they contain Cython declarations
(and sometimes code sections) which are only meant for inclusion by
Cython modules.  A ``pxd`` file is imported into a ``pyx`` module by
using the ``cimport`` keyword.

``pxd`` files have many use-cases:

1.  They can be used for sharing external C declarations.
2.  They can contain functions which are well suited for inlining by
    the C compiler. Such functions should be marked ``inline``, example::

       cdef inline int int_min(int a, int b):
           return b if b < a else a

3.  When accompanying an equally named ``pyx`` file, they
    provide a Cython interface to the Cython module so that other
    Cython modules can communicate with it using a more efficient
    protocol than the Python one.

In our integration example, we might break it up into ``pxd`` files like this:

1.  Add a ``cmath.pxd`` function which defines the C functions available from
    the C ``math.h`` header file, like ``sin``. Then one would simply do
    ``from cmath cimport sin`` in ``integrate.pyx``.
2.  Add a ``integrate.pxd`` so that other modules written in Cython
    can define fast custom functions to integrate::

       cdef class Function:
           cpdef evaluate(self, double x)
       cpdef integrate(Function f, double a,
                       double b, int N)

    Note that if you have a cdef class with attributes, the attributes must
    be declared in the class declaration ``pxd`` file (if you use one), not
    the ``pyx`` file. The compiler will tell you about this.


__init__.pxd
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Cython also supports ``__init__.pxd`` files for declarations in package's
namespaces, similar to ``__init__.py`` files in Python.

Continuing the integration example, we could package the module as follows:

1.  Place the module files in a directory tree as one usually would for
    Python:

    .. code-block:: text

        CyIntegration/
        ├── __init__.pyx
        ├── __init__.pxd
        ├── integrate.pyx
        └── integrate.pxd

2.  In ``__init__.pxd``, use ``cimport`` for any declarations that one
    would want to be available from the package's main namespace::

        from CyIntegration cimport integrate

    Other modules would then be able to use ``cimport`` on the package in
    order to recursively gain faster, Cython access to the entire package
    and the data declared in its modules::

        cimport CyIntegration
        
        cpdef do_integration(CyIntegration.integrate.Function f):
            return CyIntegration.integrate.integrate(f, 0., 2., 1)
