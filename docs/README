Cython's entire documentation suite is currently being overhauled.

For the time being, I'll use this page to post notes.

The previous Cython documentation files are hosted at
http://hg.cython.org/cython-docs


Notes
=======

1) Some css work should definitely be done.
2) Use local 'top-of-page' contents rather than the sidebar, imo.
3) Provide a link from each (sub)section to the TOC of the page.
4) Fix cython highlighter for cdef blocks
